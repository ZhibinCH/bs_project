Relevance: 8
The post is directly related to Solana, specifically discussing a technical issue with the transfer hook. The discussion of the DevNet and mainnet differences adds relevance to the platform/community interested in Solana development.

Risk: Low
The post does not contain any obvious scams, misinformation, or hate speech. The tone is neutral and seeking advice, which reduces the risk level.

Reliability: 6
The post presents a technical issue with the transfer hook, but it does not provide concrete evidence or verification from a reputable source. The fact that one person is saying it's a DevNet issue and not a mainnet problem adds some skepticism, which reduces the reliability score.

Sentiment: Neutral
The post expresses frustration and seeks confirmation before proceeding, but it does not exhibit any strong emotions, such as excitement or urgency. The overall sentiment is neutral.

Credibility: 4
The post appears to be from a user who has attempted to resolve the issue and is seeking advice. While this increases credibility, it's not a verified source, and the user may have personal biases or interests. Additionally, the post doesn't provide any credible sources to support the claims made.

1jlqsdm,USDT (SOL) vs USDT (SPL) are same ?,"
Hi Im a beginner and trying to withdraw USDT from an NFT platform, which asks for a Solana (SOL) address. However, in Trust Wallet, I only see USDT (SPL) with a warning: ""Only send USDT (SPL) to this address.""

Is USDT (SOL) the same as USDT (SPL) on Solana? Can I safely use my USDT (SPL) address from Trust Wallet for the withdrawal?

If not, are there any self-custodial wallets that accept USDT (SOL) instead of SPL? Or should I withdraw to an exchange first? Appreciate any help!
