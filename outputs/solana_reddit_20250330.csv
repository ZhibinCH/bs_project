1jmjgvs,WARNING: Airdrops I Earned Went to Binance’s Vault Instead of My Wallet — Be Careful How You Fund Your Solana Wallet,"Just discovered something seriously messed up — I made a purchase through my Solflare wallet, using USDT, expecting to receive airdrops for the Seeker mobile. 

Turns out, instead of sending the rewards to the wallet that actually made the purchase (mine), the Solana platform decided to trace the origin of the funds — and sent the airdrops to my Binance deposit address, just because that’s where I originally funded my wallet from.

So now the airdrops are sitting in Binance’s inaccessible vault, and I have no way of getting them back. Binance doesn’t show them. I can’t move them. And the wallet that actually made the transaction got nothing.

TL;DR:
	•	Don’t fund your wallet right before a drop using Binance or another exchange.
	•	Solana platforms may trace the origin of the SOL and misdirect rewards.
	•	You could miss out entirely — even if you were the one who interacted with the app and spent the money.",Existing_Existed,solana,12,0,12,0.77,29,1743244531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jmjgvs/warning_airdrops_i_earned_went_to_binances_vault/,True,159,False,SolanaMobile,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-29 10:35:31

1jlqsdm,USDT (SOL) vs USDT (SPL) are same ?,"
Hi Im a beginner and trying to withdraw USDT from an NFT platform, which asks for a Solana (SOL) address. However, in Trust Wallet, I only see USDT (SPL) with a warning: ""Only send USDT (SPL) to this address.""

Is USDT (SOL) the same as USDT (SPL) on Solana? Can I safely use my USDT (SPL) address from Trust Wallet for the withdrawal?

If not, are there any self-custodial wallets that accept USDT (SOL) instead of SPL? Or should I withdraw to an exchange first? Appreciate any help!

What I started as just a small way to give something back to the Solana community has grown into a key resource for all the developers, builders, and founders pushing Solana forward. 

I don't have any plans to ever stop, and I love bringing you a roundup of all the gems and highlights each week!

And on that note, here's the latest news for Solana developers…

# 🎫 Solana On Tour

There's been a problem with Solana events at major blockchain conferences being

hidden behind private invites, closed Telegram groups, and exclusive event lists. As a result, many in the community miss out.

Solana on Tour was created to tackle this very issue.

Solana on Tour is a public calendar and event hub designed to coordinate events, promote collaboration, and make Solana events at conferences like ETH Denver and TOKEN2049 accessible to more people.

Even if an event has limited capacity, sharing it publicly helps boost transparency and invites more collaboration across the Solana ecosystem. Solana on Tour encourages event organizers to share their events to get more people involved in the community.

# 🚅 Raiku

Solana’s known for its high performance, but developers still face issues of failed transactions, MEV issues, and congestion when demand spikes. 

Raiku is stepping in to solve these challenges head-on with a new layer of infrastructure that’s designed specifically to help apps perform at an institutional-grade level.

At its core, Raiku introduces three new transaction types that go beyond the current system: 

1. Guaranteed execution
2. Ahead-of-time inclusion signals
3. Data/proof streaming

All of this is powered by the Raiku validator network, which works in sync with Solana to deliver faster, more reliable, and more predictable outcomes.

Beyond transaction handling, Raiku is building a suite of core features designed for high-performance, next-gen apps with global accounts for unified state management, bandwidth markets to help optimize transaction flow, and RFQ-style liquidity infrastructure. 

It also introduces mechanisms for MEV protection by eliminating private mempools and improving transparency in transaction ordering, both key improvements that benefit developers and users.

One of the most interesting things about Raiku is how it decouples execution and consensus to give developers more flexibility, while giving validators new ways to earn.

Raiku is still in the early stages, early, but is trying to push the limits of what’s possible onchain.

1jlf1ew,Need Help: Script to Find Liquidity Pool Address from Token Mint (Nothing Working!),"Hey r/solana and r/solanadev,

I'm losing my mind trying to write a Python script that can find the **liquidity pool address** for a given **token mint address** (e.g., for [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), Raydium, or Orca). Every approach I’ve tried either:

* Returns empty results
* Hangs indefinitely
* Shows pools with the wrong tokens

# What I Need:

A script that:

1. Takes a **token mint address** (e.g., `8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump`)
2. Returns its **liquidity pool address** (e.g., `DUbj6toQ8aR7LFCZd26LsVbnKMPjAxSahB7eDjGurv26`)
3. Works reliably on **mainnet**

# What I’ve Tried:

1. `getProgramAccounts` with filters (fails or returns wrong pools):pythonCopyfilters = \[     {""dataSize"": 324},  # or 400     {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": token\_mint}} \]
2. **Raydium’s program ID** (`675kPX9MHTjS2zt...`) – detects pools but not mine.
3. **Pump.fun’s new program ID** (`6EF8rrecth...`) – timeouts.

# Question:

* **How do I find the correct** `offset` **for my token in the pool data?**
* **Is there a better RPC method or API (DexScreener, Birdeye, etc.)?**
* **Can someone share a working script?**



Here’s my latest failing code:

    import requests
    
    RPC_URL = ""https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com""
    MINT = ""8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump""
    
    def get_pools():
        payload = {
            ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
            ""id"": 1,
            ""method"": ""getProgramAccounts"",
            ""params"": [
                ""pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA"", 
                {
                    ""filters"": [
                        {""dataSize"": 324},
                        {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": MINT}}
                    ],
                    ""encoding"": ""base64""
                }
            ]
        }
        response = requests.post(RPC_URL, json=payload).json()
        print(response)  # EMPTY :(
    
    get_pools()

# What Happens?

* **No errors**, just empty results.
* If I remove the filter, I see pools but with **unrelated tokens**.

# Help Me Fix:

1. Is the **program ID** wrong?
2. Is the **offset** incorrect?
3. Should I use **WebSockets** instead?

1jmjgvs,WARNING: Airdrops I Earned Went to Binance’s Vault Instead of My Wallet — Be Careful How You Fund Your Solana Wallet,"Just discovered something seriously messed up — I made a purchase through my Solflare wallet, using USDT, expecting to receive airdrops for the Seeker mobile. 

Turns out, instead of sending the rewards to the wallet that actually made the purchase (mine), the Solana platform decided to trace the origin of the funds — and sent the airdrops to my Binance deposit address, just because that’s where I originally funded my wallet from.

So now the airdrops are sitting in Binance’s inaccessible vault, and I have no way of getting them back. Binance doesn’t show them. I can’t move them. And the wallet that actually made the transaction got nothing.

TL;DR:
	•	Don’t fund your wallet right before a drop using Binance or another exchange.
	•	Solana platforms may trace the origin of the SOL and misdirect rewards.
	•	You could miss out entirely — even if you were the one who interacted with the app and spent the money.",Existing_Existed,solana,12,0,12,0.77,29,1743244531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jmjgvs/warning_airdrops_i_earned_went_to_binances_vault/,True,159,False,SolanaMobile,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-29 10:35:31

1jlqsdm,USDT (SOL) vs USDT (SPL) are same ?,"
Hi Im a beginner and trying to withdraw USDT from an NFT platform, which asks for a Solana (SOL) address. However, in Trust Wallet, I only see USDT (SPL) with a warning: ""Only send USDT (SPL) to this address.""

Is USDT (SOL) the same as USDT (SPL) on Solana? Can I safely use my USDT (SPL) address from Trust Wallet for the withdrawal?

If not, are there any self-custodial wallets that accept USDT (SOL) instead of SPL? Or should I withdraw to an exchange first? Appreciate any help!

This issue marks a major milestone for me as this newsletter turns 2 years old. 🎂 

I sent my first issue on Mar 31, 2023 and it was read by a whopping 27 people. Fast-forward one year and I teamed up with Colosseum and it became the Codex, which now reaches \~45k builders each week. 

What I started as just a small way to give something back to the Solana community has grown into a key resource for all the developers, builders, and founders pushing Solana forward. 

I don't have any plans to ever stop, and I love bringing you a roundup of all the gems and highlights each week!

And on that note, here's the latest news for Solana developers…

# 🎫 Solana On Tour

There's been a problem with Solana events at major blockchain conferences being

hidden behind private invites, closed Telegram groups, and exclusive event lists. As a result, many in the community miss out.

Solana on Tour was created to tackle this very issue.

Solana on Tour is a public calendar and event hub designed to coordinate events, promote collaboration, and make Solana events at conferences like ETH Denver and TOKEN2049 accessible to more people.

Even if an event has limited capacity, sharing it publicly helps boost transparency and invites more collaboration across the Solana ecosystem. Solana on Tour encourages event organizers to share their events to get more people involved in the community.

# 🚅 Raiku

Solana’s known for its high performance, but developers still face issues of failed transactions, MEV issues, and congestion when demand spikes. 

Raiku is stepping in to solve these challenges head-on with a new layer of infrastructure that’s designed specifically to help apps perform at an institutional-grade level.

At its core, Raiku introduces three new transaction types that go beyond the current system: 

1. Guaranteed execution
2. Ahead-of-time inclusion signals
3. Data/proof streaming

All of this is powered by the Raiku validator network, which works in sync with Solana to deliver faster, more reliable, and more predictable outcomes.

Beyond transaction handling, Raiku is building a suite of core features designed for high-performance, next-gen apps with global accounts for unified state management, bandwidth markets to help optimize transaction flow, and RFQ-style liquidity infrastructure. 

It also introduces mechanisms for MEV protection by eliminating private mempools and improving transparency in transaction ordering, both key improvements that benefit developers and users.

One of the most interesting things about Raiku is how it decouples execution and consensus to give developers more flexibility, while giving validators new ways to earn.

Raiku is still in the early stages, early, but is trying to push the limits of what’s possible onchain.

1jlf1ew,Need Help: Script to Find Liquidity Pool Address from Token Mint (Nothing Working!),"Hey r/solana and r/solanadev,

I'm losing my mind trying to write a Python script that can find the **liquidity pool address** for a given **token mint address** (e.g., for [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), Raydium, or Orca). Every approach I’ve tried either:

* Returns empty results
* Hangs indefinitely
* Shows pools with the wrong tokens

# What I Need:

A script that:

1. Takes a **token mint address** (e.g., `8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump`)
2. Returns its **liquidity pool address** (e.g., `DUbj6toQ8aR7LFCZd26LsVbnKMPjAxSahB7eDjGurv26`)
3. Works reliably on **mainnet**

# What I’ve Tried:

1. `getProgramAccounts` with filters (fails or returns wrong pools):pythonCopyfilters = \[     {""dataSize"": 324},  # or 400     {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": token\_mint}} \]
2. **Raydium’s program ID** (`675kPX9MHTjS2zt...`) – detects pools but not mine.
3. **Pump.fun’s new program ID** (`6EF8rrecth...`) – timeouts.

# Question:

* **How do I find the correct** `offset` **for my token in the pool data?**
* **Is there a better RPC method or API (DexScreener, Birdeye, etc.)?**
* **Can someone share a working script?**



Here’s my latest failing code:

    import requests
    
    RPC_URL = ""https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com""
    MINT = ""8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump""
    
    def get_pools():
        payload = {
            ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
            ""id"": 1,
            ""method"": ""getProgramAccounts"",
            ""params"": [
                ""pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA"", 
                {
                    ""filters"": [
                        {""dataSize"": 324},
                        {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": MINT}}
                    ],
                    ""encoding"": ""base64""
                }
            ]
        }
        response = requests.post(RPC_URL, json=payload).json()
        print(response)  # EMPTY :(
    
    get_pools()

# What Happens?

* **No errors**, just empty results.
* If I remove the filter, I see pools but with **unrelated tokens**.

# Help Me Fix:

1. Is the **program ID** wrong?
2. Is the **offset** incorrect?
3. Should I use **WebSockets** instead?

If solana wants to be taken seriously and not taint it's image as a ""genuine"" block chain, rug pulls and scams need to go, they have to get a hold on this in my honest opinion.

I'm all for meme coins and community building etc, but, People are breaking the law everyday on solana, the block chain for criminals.

I'm just not feeling it's current direction, is this seriously the pinnacle of this tech? 

The same applies for like 90% of the crypto market, just fast cash grabs. it's just heading in a totally dumb direction, solana just happens to hold the highest concentration of degenerates.

1jk7oed,A better trading experience:,"Deep into the pump fun domination, it seems nothing else could potentially loosen the grip pump fun has over the solana space. Protocols have tried and offered their own modified versions of essentially the same product, and have had next to no success. They could offer far better terms, better creator rewards and a bunch of better things, but the users won’t budge.



In one way, this is the sign of a great product, people are happy with the ways things are and don’t want to change. This is where the volume is, where people are trading and that in itself makes the place legitimate. People aren’t willing to test out the competition, they don’t have the branding, liquidity or loyalty.



Trying to beat pump fun at its own game isn’t a winning play. Sure, you could disrupt the market, but you would never be able to make a permanent dent. But what if you didn’t try to copy pump fun, and instead provided a means to an end for what users what, in a completely unrivalled form?



Pre launch sales used to be all the hype, someone would tweet out a contract address and have millions of dollars sent straight away with no questions asked, and no clear product. (Ben.eth I’m looking at you.)While this does lead to a lot of chaos, a lot of rugs and clearly a lot of pumps, what if there was a way to get all of the benefits without having to sacrifice to the unpredictability of it all?



That’s why I have built a pre launch sale site from the ground up. Everything is completely automated, guaranteed and safe. The user no longer has to worry about if they will get their tokens or not, or if xyz influencer is going to run with the bag.



Clear parameters are one of the main focuses of the site, with the ability to set all of the intended token details, decide the amount going to the liquidity pool vs users, customisation on the creator reward for a successful launch, my site perfectly fills what is a mostly forgotten meta.



Softcap, hard cap and a countdown all add to the security of knowing exactly what’s going to happen. If your launch doesn’t hit the softcap in the designated time? No worries, the users are refunded their contributions automatically. If you do launch your pre launch sale? Everything is automated for you. From the token creation, liquidity pool management, to working out how many tokens each person needs based on their contribution. Everything is done for you.



Allowing for custom creator rewards also allows creators to show they’re not all grift. You can set your reward to 0 if this is truly something you believe in. Having the transparency of exactly where a creators loyalty resides, is one of the major benefits of having a platform like this. You can see exactly what the plans are, contribute safely and best of all, trust that at the end you will receive your end of the bargain. 



With everything fully built and pretty much ready to go, it’s a no brainer that I should have launched this already and had this available on the market. But I feel like with some better planning, branding and marketing, this platform would have all of the required elements to fully rival a giant like pump fun. If this is something that interests you, you want to see more, or you just like the idea, feel free to contact me and I’d love to hear what you think.

1jmjgvs,WARNING: Airdrops I Earned Went to Binance’s Vault Instead of My Wallet — Be Careful How You Fund Your Solana Wallet,"Just discovered something seriously messed up — I made a purchase through my Solflare wallet, using USDT, expecting to receive airdrops for the Seeker mobile. 

Turns out, instead of sending the rewards to the wallet that actually made the purchase (mine), the Solana platform decided to trace the origin of the funds — and sent the airdrops to my Binance deposit address, just because that’s where I originally funded my wallet from.

So now the airdrops are sitting in Binance’s inaccessible vault, and I have no way of getting them back. Binance doesn’t show them. I can’t move them. And the wallet that actually made the transaction got nothing.

TL;DR:
	•	Don’t fund your wallet right before a drop using Binance or another exchange.
	•	Solana platforms may trace the origin of the SOL and misdirect rewards.
	•	You could miss out entirely — even if you were the one who interacted with the app and spent the money.",Existing_Existed,solana,12,0,12,0.77,29,1743244531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jmjgvs/warning_airdrops_i_earned_went_to_binances_vault/,True,159,False,SolanaMobile,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-29 10:35:31

Hi Im a beginner and trying to withdraw USDT from an NFT platform, which asks for a Solana (SOL) address. However, in Trust Wallet, I only see USDT (SPL) with a warning: ""Only send USDT (SPL) to this address.""

Is USDT (SOL) the same as USDT (SPL) on Solana? Can I safely use my USDT (SPL) address from Trust Wallet for the withdrawal?

If not, are there any self-custodial wallets that accept USDT (SOL) instead of SPL? Or should I withdraw to an exchange first? Appreciate any help!

I sent my first issue on Mar 31, 2023 and it was read by a whopping 27 people. Fast-forward one year and I teamed up with Colosseum and it became the Codex, which now reaches \~45k builders each week. 

What I started as just a small way to give something back to the Solana community has grown into a key resource for all the developers, builders, and founders pushing Solana forward. 

I don't have any plans to ever stop, and I love bringing you a roundup of all the gems and highlights each week!

And on that note, here's the latest news for Solana developers…

# 🎫 Solana On Tour

There's been a problem with Solana events at major blockchain conferences being

hidden behind private invites, closed Telegram groups, and exclusive event lists. As a result, many in the community miss out.

Solana on Tour was created to tackle this very issue.

Solana on Tour is a public calendar and event hub designed to coordinate events, promote collaboration, and make Solana events at conferences like ETH Denver and TOKEN2049 accessible to more people.

Even if an event has limited capacity, sharing it publicly helps boost transparency and invites more collaboration across the Solana ecosystem. Solana on Tour encourages event organizers to share their events to get more people involved in the community.

# ⏱️ MagicBlock Real-Time Hackathon

MagicBlock's Real-Time Hackathon is now open, inviting Solana developers to build fully on-chain, real-time applications and games using MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology. 

This event is an opportunity to explore possibilities and prepare your project for the Solana Breakout Hackathon hosted by Colosseum.

Key highlights:

* **Exclusive Challenges**: Develop pioneering apps in DeFi, gaming, and social media, pushing the limits of real-time blockchain technology.
* **Significant Prizes**: Compete to win up to $10,000 in funding
* **Full MagicBlock Tech Access**: Advanced ephemeral rollup technology to build decentralized and serverless applications with unprecedented speed and scalability.

Suggested projects include creating a real-time central limit order book (CLOB), intuitive options trading platforms, real-time trading news apps, and fully on-chain PvP games. 

Real-time offers developers a platform for visibility to gather feedback and refine their projects ahead of the upcoming Breakout Hackathon.

# 🚅 Raiku

Solana’s known for its high performance, but developers still face issues of failed transactions, MEV issues, and congestion when demand spikes. 

Raiku is stepping in to solve these challenges head-on with a new layer of infrastructure that’s designed specifically to help apps perform at an institutional-grade level.

At its core, Raiku introduces three new transaction types that go beyond the current system: 

1. Guaranteed execution
2. Ahead-of-time inclusion signals
3. Data/proof streaming

All of this is powered by the Raiku validator network, which works in sync with Solana to deliver faster, more reliable, and more predictable outcomes.

Beyond transaction handling, Raiku is building a suite of core features designed for high-performance, next-gen apps with global accounts for unified state management, bandwidth markets to help optimize transaction flow, and RFQ-style liquidity infrastructure. 

It also introduces mechanisms for MEV protection by eliminating private mempools and improving transparency in transaction ordering, both key improvements that benefit developers and users.

One of the most interesting things about Raiku is how it decouples execution and consensus to give developers more flexibility, while giving validators new ways to earn.

Raiku is still in the early stages, early, but is trying to push the limits of what’s possible onchain.

Stablecoin activity on Solana is booming, and it’s not just a side effect of the memecoin frenzy. With over $1.2 billion in stablecoins minted in March and total supply hitting its highest point since early 2021, new onchain data shows growth across the board. This deep dive breaks down where that supply is going, who’s using it, how trading volume is shifting, and why stablecoins are a foundational layer of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.

[**A Data-Driven Analysis of Frankendancer**](https://chorus.one/articles/is-the-speed-of-light-too-slow?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
Frankendancer, the first iteration of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer validator client, is showing real performance gains on-chain. This data-driven analysis from Chorus One explores how Frankendancer handles more transactions per block than Agave, achieves higher throughput with lower median priority fees, and uses smarter scheduling to resolve transaction conflicts more efficiently, breaking down the numbers behind Firedancer’s promise to push Solana to the limits of what’s possible.

# 🎧 Listen to This

# Lightspeed

In this episode of Lightspeed, host Jack Kubinec talks with Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, and Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, about the future of Solana and the broader landscape of blockchain technologies.

The discussion covers innovations in market structures, the importance of tokenization, the vision for Internet capital markets, and the implications of potential Solana ETFs.

The conversation included a future vision for Solana involving multiple concurrent leaders to improve market efficiency. Anatoly also addressed concerns surrounding meme coins, suggesting they serve as a benign entry into crypto markets, while stressing the need for better launch tools to promote fairness and reliability.

Both speakers expressed optimism regarding the upcoming Solana ETFs and the potential for staking yields to attract investors, emphasizing that the market's evolution is likely to overshadow current meme coin trends.

Both Anatoly and Kyle reflected on Solana’s growth over five years and how the ecosystem is continuously growing and diversifying.

1jlf1ew,Need Help: Script to Find Liquidity Pool Address from Token Mint (Nothing Working!),"Hey r/solana and r/solanadev,

I'm losing my mind trying to write a Python script that can find the **liquidity pool address** for a given **token mint address** (e.g., for [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), Raydium, or Orca). Every approach I’ve tried either:

* Returns empty results
* Hangs indefinitely
* Shows pools with the wrong tokens

# What I Need:

A script that:

1. Takes a **token mint address** (e.g., `8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump`)
2. Returns its **liquidity pool address** (e.g., `DUbj6toQ8aR7LFCZd26LsVbnKMPjAxSahB7eDjGurv26`)
3. Works reliably on **mainnet**

# What I’ve Tried:

1. `getProgramAccounts` with filters (fails or returns wrong pools):pythonCopyfilters = \[     {""dataSize"": 324},  # or 400     {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": token\_mint}} \]
2. **Raydium’s program ID** (`675kPX9MHTjS2zt...`) – detects pools but not mine.
3. **Pump.fun’s new program ID** (`6EF8rrecth...`) – timeouts.

# Question:

* **How do I find the correct** `offset` **for my token in the pool data?**
* **Is there a better RPC method or API (DexScreener, Birdeye, etc.)?**
* **Can someone share a working script?**



Here’s my latest failing code:

    import requests
    
    RPC_URL = ""https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com""
    MINT = ""8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump""
    
    def get_pools():
        payload = {
            ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
            ""id"": 1,
            ""method"": ""getProgramAccounts"",
            ""params"": [
                ""pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA"", 
                {
                    ""filters"": [
                        {""dataSize"": 324},
                        {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": MINT}}
                    ],
                    ""encoding"": ""base64""
                }
            ]
        }
        response = requests.post(RPC_URL, json=payload).json()
        print(response)  # EMPTY :(
    
    get_pools()

# What Happens?

* **No errors**, just empty results.
* If I remove the filter, I see pools but with **unrelated tokens**.

# Help Me Fix:

1. Is the **program ID** wrong?
2. Is the **offset** incorrect?
3. Should I use **WebSockets** instead?

1jk8e62,Pump.fun etc needs to end.,"Bit of a rant.

If solana wants to be taken seriously and not taint it's image as a ""genuine"" block chain, rug pulls and scams need to go, they have to get a hold on this in my honest opinion.

I'm all for meme coins and community building etc, but, People are breaking the law everyday on solana, the block chain for criminals.

I'm just not feeling it's current direction, is this seriously the pinnacle of this tech? 

The same applies for like 90% of the crypto market, just fast cash grabs. it's just heading in a totally dumb direction, solana just happens to hold the highest concentration of degenerates.

I can't be the only one here??

1jk7oed,A better trading experience:,"Deep into the pump fun domination, it seems nothing else could potentially loosen the grip pump fun has over the solana space. Protocols have tried and offered their own modified versions of essentially the same product, and have had next to no success. They could offer far better terms, better creator rewards and a bunch of better things, but the users won’t budge.



In one way, this is the sign of a great product, people are happy with the ways things are and don’t want to change. This is where the volume is, where people are trading and that in itself makes the place legitimate. People aren’t willing to test out the competition, they don’t have the branding, liquidity or loyalty.



Trying to beat pump fun at its own game isn’t a winning play. Sure, you could disrupt the market, but you would never be able to make a permanent dent. But what if you didn’t try to copy pump fun, and instead provided a means to an end for what users what, in a completely unrivalled form?



Pre launch sales used to be all the hype, someone would tweet out a contract address and have millions of dollars sent straight away with no questions asked, and no clear product. (Ben.eth I’m looking at you.)While this does lead to a lot of chaos, a lot of rugs and clearly a lot of pumps, what if there was a way to get all of the benefits without having to sacrifice to the unpredictability of it all?



That’s why I have built a pre launch sale site from the ground up. Everything is completely automated, guaranteed and safe. The user no longer has to worry about if they will get their tokens or not, or if xyz influencer is going to run with the bag.



Clear parameters are one of the main focuses of the site, with the ability to set all of the intended token details, decide the amount going to the liquidity pool vs users, customisation on the creator reward for a successful launch, my site perfectly fills what is a mostly forgotten meta.



Softcap, hard cap and a countdown all add to the security of knowing exactly what’s going to happen. If your launch doesn’t hit the softcap in the designated time? No worries, the users are refunded their contributions automatically. If you do launch your pre launch sale? Everything is automated for you. From the token creation, liquidity pool management, to working out how many tokens each person needs based on their contribution. Everything is done for you.



Allowing for custom creator rewards also allows creators to show they’re not all grift. You can set your reward to 0 if this is truly something you believe in. Having the transparency of exactly where a creators loyalty resides, is one of the major benefits of having a platform like this. You can see exactly what the plans are, contribute safely and best of all, trust that at the end you will receive your end of the bargain. 



With everything fully built and pretty much ready to go, it’s a no brainer that I should have launched this already and had this available on the market. But I feel like with some better planning, branding and marketing, this platform would have all of the required elements to fully rival a giant like pump fun. If this is something that interests you, you want to see more, or you just like the idea, feel free to contact me and I’d love to hear what you think.

1jjmnva,"XRP is the biggest shitcoin, prove me wrong! pt.2","I made the attached post few hours ago and seems lot of XRP fanboys are furious, so lets double down!

\*\*1. XRP acts as a bridge currency between banks and financial institutions, crypto aims to replace the very thing!

a. the main counterpoint here was XRP is fast & cost effective compared to SWIFT and would be a great idea to replace the existing tech with XRPL sure not a bad idea lets assume XRP somehow manages to replace SWIFT their only competitor and lately there have been some partnership rumours (ironic), but yeah lets calculate the valuation of SWIFT if it were publicly listed company...

SWIFT generates revenue by charging fees for its services, primarily per-message fees which is somewhere around 0.2$, SWIFT processed 44 million messages daily, totalling approximately 16 billion messages annually.

16 billion messages × $0.20/message = $3.2 billion in revenue.

Valuation Calculation:

Revenue: $3.2 billion.

P/S Range: 10 to 15 (industry avg.)

Lower end: $3.2 billion × 10 = $32 billion.

Upper end: $3.2 billion × 15 = $48 billion.

so hypothetically XRP should be worth 48B in mcap, but taking over a existing industry monopoly is highly unlikely.

\*\*2.  XRP does not use POW or POS so nothing in it for community, so everyone who praises are like cult followers similar to that of shitcoin.

a. Validator nodes on the XRP Ledger have earned 0 XRP from the network since launch, as transaction fees are burned with no direct rewards.

b. XRPL selects who can run a node on the network.

\*\*3. Transaction speed is faster for XRP(since centralised) so does solana and dozens of eth L2's.

a. Solana and Polygon each processes 65,000tx/s which is faster than that of XRP's 1500tx/s.

b.  XRPL selects who can run a node on the network, which is changing lately but with no incentive to run a node!

\*\*4. XRP has 100B pre-mined, 47% circulating/ dumped on retail owns 53% in escrow accounts, which is worse than shitcoins!

a. I've been little off on this one but what i found out was way worse...

b. XRP debuted with a fixed total supply of 100 billion pre-mined tokens created in full at launch (compare that with pumpfun shitcoins have 1B total supply).

c. Ripple’s founders (e.g., Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen) and early investors got 20B in total, thats 20% of total supply.

d. Based on current data xrp has so far dumped 58B tokens on retail with as much as removal of 1B XRP per month from escrow. i,e 2.44 Billion dollar (based on current valuation) ready to dump on retail.

e. so far **13,698,922** XRP has been burned in fees which is 0.0137% of total supply.

\*\*5. Bonus point for all those who like to compare XRP with SOLANA and ETH!

|Metric|XRP|Solana|Ethereum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NFTs/Memecoins|($6M memecoin vol, $10M+ NFT vol)|($2.5B memecoin vol, billions NFT)|(billions in NFT/memecoin vol)|
|TVL|\~$20M|\~$10B+|\~$100B|
|Product Volume|$6M/day (memes), billions in payments|Billions/day (NFTs, DeFi, memes)|Tens of billions/day (NFTs, DeFi)|
|Revenue|\~$54,794/day)|$4M+/day|$5–10M+/day|

Most common/stupidest comment on the post...

\*The most common comment was everything is shitcoin except bitcoin! To those I would like to say... anything on blockchain that is decentralised and produces revenue annually by any means is backed by that revenue and thus not a shitcoin! eg, sol, eth and multiple other protocols!

\*The only reason I posted it on solana sub because I consider myself integral part of the solana community and rest can go get rugged!

p.s if you want me to post another thread on how much i actually think XRP is worth let me know in comments!

1jjgj0v,I tested a bunch of Solana RPC providers — here’s my take 🧵,"Spent the last few weeks testing Solana RPCs for NFT stuff, bots, dashboards, etc. Here's my personal breakdown of Helius, InstantNodes, QuickNode, Ligma, and Triton:

**🥇 Helius – The all-in-one Solana dev toolbox**

If you’re building anything on Solana and want prebuilt tools like NFT APIs, token portfolio data, or real-time webhooks — Helius makes life so much easier. It basically gives you indexing and infra in one. Their DAS API is 🔥 and webhook system is a game changer for reacting to mints, transfers, etc. Performance is solid and scales well.

**🥈 InstantNodes – Fastest for heavy data & smart routing**

This one surprised me. InstantNodes uses a hybrid setup where light RPC calls go to shared nodes, and heavy ones (like big account scans or getProgramAccounts) get routed to beefier backend nodes. It means everything stays snappy even under load. Great for dashboards, bots, or any app hammering the RPC. Support is via Telegram, and while it’s helpful, it doesn’t feel very “enterprise” — there’s not much in terms of dashboards or monitoring tools. Also, no free tier — plans start around $499/month.

**🥉 QuickNode — reliable, polished, and great for multi-chain apps**

QuickNode’s biggest win is how easy it is to get started — the dashboard is clean, you get 10M free credits monthly, and it supports multiple chains out of the box. Perfect for MVPs or wallets that touch more than just Solana. Performance is solid, though if you're doing anything latency-sensitive or Solana-specific (like racing mints), you’ll probably want to upgrade — the free tier isn’t super snappy, and some Solana features (like Streams) require writing JS filters or paying for add-ons. Still, it's very dev-friendly and scalable if you're not doing ultra low-latency stuff.

**⚡ Ligma — built for degen botters and mint snipers**  
  
This one’s designed for raw transaction speed. They claim up to 6,000+ TPS, and they partner with validators to help your TXs land faster. In testing, it absolutely gives bots an edge in congested moments like mints. You get gRPC support, direct IP access (which cuts latency even more), and high TX throughput even on shared plans. But it’s definitely not polished — docs are barebones, support is all Telegram/Discord, and there’s no real dashboard. If you’re cool with that and just want raw power for bots or sniping, it does the job really well.

**💰 Triton — premium option for mission-critical infra**  
  
Triton feels like the most ""serious"" option out there. Their infra is built to never go down — they use multiple regions and providers, so even if a datacenter dies, your app stays up. You can get dedicated nodes with super low latency (\~400ms or better), which is great for exchanges, market makers, or liquidation bots. But this comes at a cost: you’re looking at $500/month minimum, and they don’t offer fancy APIs or a free tier — it’s pure RPC. If you’re running something that absolutely can’t fail, it’s worth every dollar. But for smaller apps or solo devs, it’s likely overkill.",rfjtdjhc,solana,30,0,30,0.93,19,1742899758.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jjgj0v/i_tested_a_bunch_of_solana_rpc_providers_heres_my/,True,506,False,DeFi,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-25 10:49:18
1jmjgvs,WARNING: Airdrops I Earned Went to Binance’s Vault Instead of My Wallet — Be Careful How You Fund Your Solana Wallet,"Just discovered something seriously messed up — I made a purchase through my Solflare wallet, using USDT, expecting to receive airdrops for the Seeker mobile. 

Turns out, instead of sending the rewards to the wallet that actually made the purchase (mine), the Solana platform decided to trace the origin of the funds — and sent the airdrops to my Binance deposit address, just because that’s where I originally funded my wallet from.

So now the airdrops are sitting in Binance’s inaccessible vault, and I have no way of getting them back. Binance doesn’t show them. I can’t move them. And the wallet that actually made the transaction got nothing.

TL;DR:
	•	Don’t fund your wallet right before a drop using Binance or another exchange.
	•	Solana platforms may trace the origin of the SOL and misdirect rewards.
	•	You could miss out entirely — even if you were the one who interacted with the app and spent the money.",Existing_Existed,solana,11,0,11,0.74,29,1743244531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jmjgvs/warning_airdrops_i_earned_went_to_binances_vault/,True,159,False,SolanaMobile,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-29 10:35:31

1jlqsdm,USDT (SOL) vs USDT (SPL) are same ?,"
Hi Im a beginner and trying to withdraw USDT from an NFT platform, which asks for a Solana (SOL) address. However, in Trust Wallet, I only see USDT (SPL) with a warning: ""Only send USDT (SPL) to this address.""

Is USDT (SOL) the same as USDT (SPL) on Solana? Can I safely use my USDT (SPL) address from Trust Wallet for the withdrawal?

If not, are there any self-custodial wallets that accept USDT (SOL) instead of SPL? Or should I withdraw to an exchange first? Appreciate any help!

I sent my first issue on Mar 31, 2023 and it was read by a whopping 27 people. Fast-forward one year and I teamed up with Colosseum and it became the Codex, which now reaches \~45k builders each week. 

What I started as just a small way to give something back to the Solana community has grown into a key resource for all the developers, builders, and founders pushing Solana forward. 

I don't have any plans to ever stop, and I love bringing you a roundup of all the gems and highlights each week!

And on that note, here's the latest news for Solana developers…

# 🎫 Solana On Tour

There's been a problem with Solana events at major blockchain conferences being

hidden behind private invites, closed Telegram groups, and exclusive event lists. As a result, many in the community miss out.

Solana on Tour was created to tackle this very issue.

Solana on Tour is a public calendar and event hub designed to coordinate events, promote collaboration, and make Solana events at conferences like ETH Denver and TOKEN2049 accessible to more people.

Even if an event has limited capacity, sharing it publicly helps boost transparency and invites more collaboration across the Solana ecosystem. Solana on Tour encourages event organizers to share their events to get more people involved in the community.

# ⏱️ MagicBlock Real-Time Hackathon

MagicBlock's Real-Time Hackathon is now open, inviting Solana developers to build fully on-chain, real-time applications and games using MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology. 

This event is an opportunity to explore possibilities and prepare your project for the Solana Breakout Hackathon hosted by Colosseum.

Key highlights:

* **Exclusive Challenges**: Develop pioneering apps in DeFi, gaming, and social media, pushing the limits of real-time blockchain technology.
* **Significant Prizes**: Compete to win up to $10,000 in funding
* **Full MagicBlock Tech Access**: Advanced ephemeral rollup technology to build decentralized and serverless applications with unprecedented speed and scalability.

Suggested projects include creating a real-time central limit order book (CLOB), intuitive options trading platforms, real-time trading news apps, and fully on-chain PvP games.

# 🚅 Raiku

Solana’s known for its high performance, but developers still face issues of failed transactions, MEV issues, and congestion when demand spikes. 

Raiku is stepping in to solve these challenges head-on with a new layer of infrastructure that’s designed specifically to help apps perform at an institutional-grade level.

At its core, Raiku introduces three new transaction types that go beyond the current system: 

1. Guaranteed execution
2. Ahead-of-time inclusion signals
3. Data/proof streaming

All of this is powered by the Raiku validator network, which works in sync with Solana to deliver faster, more reliable, and more predictable outcomes.

Beyond transaction handling, Raiku is building a suite of core features designed for high-performance, next-gen apps with global accounts for unified state management, bandwidth markets to help optimize transaction flow, and RFQ-style liquidity infrastructure. 

It also introduces mechanisms for MEV protection by eliminating private mempools and improving transparency in transaction ordering, both key improvements that benefit developers and users.

One of the most interesting things about Raiku is how it decouples execution and consensus to give developers more flexibility, while giving validators new ways to earn.

Raiku is still in the early stages, early, but is trying to push the limits of what’s possible onchain.

# ⭐ Highlights of the Week

[**Solana Governance: A Comprehensive Analysis**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-governance--a-comprehensive-analysis?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
This deep dive into governance on Solana from Helius explores how decisions get made on Solana, who actually holds the power, and what recent high-stakes votes reveal about the strengths and growing pains of its governance model. Whether you’re a validator, developer, or staker trying to understand your role in shaping Solana's future, this comprehensive analysis breaks it all down.

[**A Deep Dive into Onchain Stablecoin Data**](https://solanafloor.com/news/stablecoin-supply-on-solana-hits-record-highs-a-deep-dive-into-onchain-data?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
Stablecoin activity on Solana is booming, and it’s not just a side effect of the memecoin frenzy. With over $1.2 billion in stablecoins minted in March and total supply hitting its highest point since early 2021, new onchain data shows growth across the board. This deep dive breaks down where that supply is going, who’s using it, how trading volume is shifting, and why stablecoins are a foundational layer of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.

[**A Data-Driven Analysis of Frankendancer**](https://chorus.one/articles/is-the-speed-of-light-too-slow?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
Frankendancer, the first iteration of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer validator client, is showing real performance gains on-chain. This data-driven analysis from Chorus One explores how Frankendancer handles more transactions per block than Agave, achieves higher throughput with lower median priority fees, and uses smarter scheduling to resolve transaction conflicts more efficiently, breaking down the numbers behind Firedancer’s promise to push Solana to the limits of what’s possible.

1jlf1ew,Need Help: Script to Find Liquidity Pool Address from Token Mint (Nothing Working!),"Hey r/solana and r/solanadev,

I'm losing my mind trying to write a Python script that can find the **liquidity pool address** for a given **token mint address** (e.g., for [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), Raydium, or Orca). Every approach I’ve tried either:

* Returns empty results
* Hangs indefinitely
* Shows pools with the wrong tokens

# What I Need:

A script that:

1. Takes a **token mint address** (e.g., `8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump`)
2. Returns its **liquidity pool address** (e.g., `DUbj6toQ8aR7LFCZd26LsVbnKMPjAxSahB7eDjGurv26`)
3. Works reliably on **mainnet**

# What I’ve Tried:

1. `getProgramAccounts` with filters (fails or returns wrong pools):pythonCopyfilters = \[     {""dataSize"": 324},  # or 400     {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": token\_mint}} \]
2. **Raydium’s program ID** (`675kPX9MHTjS2zt...`) – detects pools but not mine.
3. **Pump.fun’s new program ID** (`6EF8rrecth...`) – timeouts.

# Question:

* **How do I find the correct** `offset` **for my token in the pool data?**
* **Is there a better RPC method or API (DexScreener, Birdeye, etc.)?**
* **Can someone share a working script?**



Here’s my latest failing code:

    import requests
    
    RPC_URL = ""https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com""
    MINT = ""8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump""
    
    def get_pools():
        payload = {
            ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
            ""id"": 1,
            ""method"": ""getProgramAccounts"",
            ""params"": [
                ""pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA"", 
                {
                    ""filters"": [
                        {""dataSize"": 324},
                        {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": MINT}}
                    ],
                    ""encoding"": ""base64""
                }

1jk7oed,A better trading experience:,"Deep into the pump fun domination, it seems nothing else could potentially loosen the grip pump fun has over the solana space. Protocols have tried and offered their own modified versions of essentially the same product, and have had next to no success. They could offer far better terms, better creator rewards and a bunch of better things, but the users won’t budge.



In one way, this is the sign of a great product, people are happy with the ways things are and don’t want to change. This is where the volume is, where people are trading and that in itself makes the place legitimate. People aren’t willing to test out the competition, they don’t have the branding, liquidity or loyalty.



Trying to beat pump fun at its own game isn’t a winning play. Sure, you could disrupt the market, but you would never be able to make a permanent dent. But what if you didn’t try to copy pump fun, and instead provided a means to an end for what users what, in a completely unrivalled form?



Pre launch sales used to be all the hype, someone would tweet out a contract address and have millions of dollars sent straight away with no questions asked, and no clear product. (Ben.eth I’m looking at you.)While this does lead to a lot of chaos, a lot of rugs and clearly a lot of pumps, what if there was a way to get all of the benefits without having to sacrifice to the unpredictability of it all?



That’s why I have built a pre launch sale site from the ground up. Everything is completely automated, guaranteed and safe. The user no longer has to worry about if they will get their tokens or not, or if xyz influencer is going to run with the bag.



Clear parameters are one of the main focuses of the site, with the ability to set all of the intended token details, decide the amount going to the liquidity pool vs users, customisation on the creator reward for a successful launch, my site perfectly fills what is a mostly forgotten meta.



Softcap, hard cap and a countdown all add to the security of knowing exactly what’s going to happen. If your launch doesn’t hit the softcap in the designated time? No worries, the users are refunded their contributions automatically. If you do launch your pre launch sale? Everything is automated for you. From the token creation, liquidity pool management, to working out how many tokens each person needs based on their contribution. Everything is done for you.



Allowing for custom creator rewards also allows creators to show they’re not all grift. You can set your reward to 0 if this is truly something you believe in. Having the transparency of exactly where a creators loyalty resides, is one of the major benefits of having a platform like this. You can see exactly what the plans are, contribute safely and best of all, trust that at the end you will receive your end of the bargain. 



With everything fully built and pretty much ready to go, it’s a no brainer that I should have launched this already and had this available on the market. But I feel like with some better planning, branding and marketing, this platform would have all of the required elements to fully rival a giant like pump fun. If this is something that interests you, you want to see more, or you just like the idea, feel free to contact me and I’d love to hear what you think.

1jjmnva,"XRP is the biggest shitcoin, prove me wrong! pt.2","I made the attached post few hours ago and seems lot of XRP fanboys are furious, so lets double down!

\*\*1. XRP acts as a bridge currency between banks and financial institutions, crypto aims to replace the very thing!

a. the main counterpoint here was XRP is fast & cost effective compared to SWIFT and would be a great idea to replace the existing tech with XRPL sure not a bad idea lets assume XRP somehow manages to replace SWIFT their only competitor and lately there have been some partnership rumours (ironic), but yeah lets calculate the valuation of SWIFT if it were publicly listed company...

SWIFT generates revenue by charging fees for its services, primarily per-message fees which is somewhere around 0.2$, SWIFT processed 44 million messages daily, totalling approximately 16 billion messages annually.

16 billion messages × $0.20/message = $3.2 billion in revenue.

Valuation Calculation:

Revenue: $3.2 billion.

P/S Range: 10 to 15 (industry avg.)

Lower end: $3.2 billion × 10 = $32 billion.

Upper end: $3.2 billion × 15 = $48 billion.

so hypothetically XRP should be worth 48B in mcap, but taking over a existing industry monopoly is highly unlikely.

\*\*2.  XRP does not use POW or POS so nothing in it for community, so everyone who praises are like cult followers similar to that of shitcoin.

a. Validator nodes on the XRP Ledger have earned 0 XRP from the network since launch, as transaction fees are burned with no direct rewards.

b. XRPL selects who can run a node on the network.

\*\*3. Transaction speed is faster for XRP(since centralised) so does solana and dozens of eth L2's.

a. Solana and Polygon each processes 65,000tx/s which is faster than that of XRP's 1500tx/s.

b.  XRPL selects who can run a node on the network, which is changing lately but with no incentive to run a node!

\*\*4. XRP has 100B pre-mined, 47% circulating/ dumped on retail owns 53% in escrow accounts, which is worse than shitcoins!

a. I've been little off on this one but what i found out was way worse...

b. XRP debuted with a fixed total supply of 100 billion pre-mined tokens created in full at launch (compare that with pumpfun shitcoins have 1B total supply).

c. Ripple’s founders (e.g., Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen) and early investors got 20B in total, thats 20% of total supply.

d. Based on current data xrp has so far dumped 58B tokens on retail with as much as removal of 1B XRP per month from escrow. i,e 2.44 Billion dollar (based on current valuation) ready to dump on retail.

e. so far **13,698,922** XRP has been burned in fees which is 0.0137% of total supply.

\*\*5. Bonus point for all those who like to compare XRP with SOLANA and ETH!

|Metric|XRP|Solana|Ethereum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NFTs/Memecoins|($6M memecoin vol, $10M+ NFT vol)|($2.5B memecoin vol, billions NFT)|(billions in NFT/memecoin vol)|
|TVL|\~$20M|\~$10B+|\~$100B|
|Product Volume|$6M/day (memes), billions in payments|Billions/day (NFTs, DeFi, memes)|Tens of billions/day (NFTs, DeFi)|
|Revenue|\~$54,794/day)|$4M+/day|$5–10M+/day|

Most common/stupidest comment on the post...

\*The most common comment was everything is shitcoin except bitcoin! To those I would like to say... anything on blockchain that is decentralised and produces revenue annually by any means is backed by that revenue and thus not a shitcoin! eg, sol, eth and multiple other protocols!

\*The only reason I posted it on solana sub because I consider myself integral part of the solana community and rest can go get rugged!

p.s if you want me to post another thread on how much i actually think XRP is worth let me know in comments!

1jjgj0v,I tested a bunch of Solana RPC providers — here’s my take 🧵,"Spent the last few weeks testing Solana RPCs for NFT stuff, bots, dashboards, etc. Here's my personal breakdown of Helius, InstantNodes, QuickNode, Ligma, and Triton:

**🥇 Helius – The all-in-one Solana dev toolbox**

If you’re building anything on Solana and want prebuilt tools like NFT APIs, token portfolio data, or real-time webhooks — Helius makes life so much easier. It basically gives you indexing and infra in one. Their DAS API is 🔥 and webhook system is a game changer for reacting to mints, transfers, etc. Performance is solid and scales well.

**🥈 InstantNodes – Fastest for heavy data & smart routing**

This one surprised me. InstantNodes uses a hybrid setup where light RPC calls go to shared nodes, and heavy ones (like big account scans or getProgramAccounts) get routed to beefier backend nodes. It means everything stays snappy even under load. Great for dashboards, bots, or any app hammering the RPC. Support is via Telegram, and while it’s helpful, it doesn’t feel very “enterprise” — there’s not much in terms of dashboards or monitoring tools. Also, no free tier — plans start around $499/month.

**🥉 QuickNode — reliable, polished, and great for multi-chain apps**

QuickNode’s biggest win is how easy it is to get started — the dashboard is clean, you get 10M free credits monthly, and it supports multiple chains out of the box. Perfect for MVPs or wallets that touch more than just Solana. Performance is solid, though if you're doing anything latency-sensitive or Solana-specific (like racing mints), you’ll probably want to upgrade — the free tier isn’t super snappy, and some Solana features (like Streams) require writing JS filters or paying for add-ons. Still, it's very dev-friendly and scalable if you're not doing ultra low-latency stuff.

**⚡ Ligma — built for degen botters and mint snipers**  
  
This one’s designed for raw transaction speed. They claim up to 6,000+ TPS, and they partner with validators to help your TXs land faster. In testing, it absolutely gives bots an edge in congested moments like mints. You get gRPC support, direct IP access (which cuts latency even more), and high TX throughput even on shared plans. But it’s definitely not polished — docs are barebones, support is all Telegram/Discord, and there’s no real dashboard. If you’re cool with that and just want raw power for bots or sniping, it does the job really well.

**💰 Triton — premium option for mission-critical infra**  
  
Triton feels like the most ""serious"" option out there. Their infra is built to never go down — they use multiple regions and providers, so even if a datacenter dies, your app stays up. You can get dedicated nodes with super low latency (\~400ms or better), which is great for exchanges, market makers, or liquidation bots. But this comes at a cost: you’re looking at $500/month minimum, and they don’t offer fancy APIs or a free tier — it’s pure RPC. If you’re running something that absolutely can’t fail, it’s worth every dollar. But for smaller apps or solo devs, it’s likely overkill.",rfjtdjhc,solana,29,0,29,0.95,19,1742899758.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jjgj0v/i_tested_a_bunch_of_solana_rpc_providers_heres_my/,True,506,False,DeFi,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-25 10:49:18

# Why Iris?

* **Outsmart Jito**: Our routing logic bypasses broken schedulers. Your fees *actually* matter here.
* **Slash Through TPU Chaos**: Paladin, \[Redacted\]? Iris auto-detects and routes with surgical precision.
* **Stat or Die Trying**: 0-1 slot landings for 90% of transactions. *Try us.*
* **No PhD Required**: Integrate in 5 lines of code. Spend less time debugging, more time printing.

1jipixf,Is it possible to restrict minted tokens to only be tradable within my private platform (Solana)?,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a private platform on Solana where users can mint tokens. However, I want to **limit trading of these minted tokens strictly within my platform**. The goal is that **only registered users of my platform can hold, buy, or sell these tokens**, and **no external bots or actors should be able to snipe the token supply** or interact with it in any way.

From what I’ve read, at the moment of token creation on Solana, **some bots are able to detect the mint and buy up supply within seconds**, which is exactly what I want to prevent.

So the core question is:

Is there a way to mint tokens on Solana that are only tradable (or even visible) within a private ecosystem and cannot be accessed or purchased by external parties or bots?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm open to workarounds like custom smart contracts, gating mechanisms, or even hybrid solutions—anything that would allow me to protect early-stage token distribution and enforce exclusivity for my users.

Any help, pointers, or advice would be massively appreciated. Thanks!

ps : the reason i want to do this is that I want to avoid abusive speculation AND unknown actors.  
The tokens are meant for real users within my platform, not bots or external traders looking to flip them instantly.",Super_Swim_8540,solana,6,0,6,0.8,32,1742819501.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jipixf/is_it_possible_to_restrict_minted_tokens_to_only/,True,216,False,DeFi,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-24 12:31:41

1jmjgvs,WARNING: Airdrops I Earned Went to Binance’s Vault Instead of My Wallet — Be Careful How You Fund Your Solana Wallet,"Just discovered something seriously messed up — I made a purchase through my Solflare wallet, using USDT, expecting to receive airdrops for the Seeker mobile. 

Turns out, instead of sending the rewards to the wallet that actually made the purchase (mine), the Solana platform decided to trace the origin of the funds — and sent the airdrops to my Binance deposit address, just because that’s where I originally funded my wallet from.

So now the airdrops are sitting in Binance’s inaccessible vault, and I have no way of getting them back. Binance doesn’t show them. I can’t move them. And the wallet that actually made the transaction got nothing.

TL;DR:
	•	Don’t fund your wallet right before a drop using Binance or another exchange.
	•	Solana platforms may trace the origin of the SOL and misdirect rewards.
	•	You could miss out entirely — even if you were the one who interacted with the app and spent the money.",Existing_Existed,solana,12,0,12,0.73,29,1743244531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jmjgvs/warning_airdrops_i_earned_went_to_binances_vault/,True,159,False,SolanaMobile,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-29 10:35:31

# 🎫 Solana On Tour

There's been a problem with Solana events at major blockchain conferences being

hidden behind private invites, closed Telegram groups, and exclusive event lists. As a result, many in the community miss out.

Solana on Tour was created to tackle this very issue.

Solana on Tour is a public calendar and event hub designed to coordinate events, promote collaboration, and make Solana events at conferences like ETH Denver and TOKEN2049 accessible to more people.

Even if an event has limited capacity, sharing it publicly helps boost transparency and invites more collaboration across the Solana ecosystem. Solana on Tour encourages event organizers to share their events to get more people involved in the community.

# ⏱️ MagicBlock Real-Time Hackathon

MagicBlock's Real-Time Hackathon is now open, inviting Solana developers to build fully on-chain, real-time applications and games using MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology. 

This event is an opportunity to explore possibilities and prepare your project for the Solana Breakout Hackathon hosted by Colosseum.

Key highlights:

* **Exclusive Challenges**: Develop pioneering apps in DeFi, gaming, and social media, pushing the limits of real-time blockchain technology.
* **Significant Prizes**: Compete to win up to $10,000 in funding
* **Full MagicBlock Tech Access**: Advanced ephemeral rollup technology to build decentralized and serverless applications with unprecedented speed and scalability.

Suggested projects include creating a real-time central limit order book (CLOB), intuitive options trading platforms, real-time trading news apps, and fully on-chain PvP games. 

Real-time offers developers a platform for visibility to gather feedback and refine their projects ahead of the upcoming Breakout Hackathon.

# 🚅 Raiku

Solana’s known for its high performance, but developers still face issues of failed transactions, MEV issues, and congestion when demand spikes. 

Raiku is stepping in to solve these challenges head-on with a new layer of infrastructure that’s designed specifically to help apps perform at an institutional-grade level.

At its core, Raiku introduces three new transaction types that go beyond the current system: 

1. Guaranteed execution
2. Ahead-of-time inclusion signals
3. Data/proof streaming

All of this is powered by the Raiku validator network, which works in sync with Solana to deliver faster, more reliable, and more predictable outcomes.

Beyond transaction handling, Raiku is building a suite of core features designed for high-performance, next-gen apps with global accounts for unified state management, bandwidth markets to help optimize transaction flow, and RFQ-style liquidity infrastructure. 

It also introduces mechanisms for MEV protection by eliminating private mempools and improving transparency in transaction ordering, both key improvements that benefit developers and users.

One of the most interesting things about Raiku is how it decouples execution and consensus to give developers more flexibility, while giving validators new ways to earn.

Raiku is still in the early stages, early, but is trying to push the limits of what’s possible onchain.

# ⭐ Highlights of the Week

[**Solana Governance: A Comprehensive Analysis**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-governance--a-comprehensive-analysis?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
This deep dive into governance on Solana from Helius explores how decisions get made on Solana, who actually holds the power, and what recent high-stakes votes reveal about the strengths and growing pains of its governance model. Whether you’re a validator, developer, or staker trying to understand your role in shaping Solana's future, this comprehensive analysis breaks it all down.

[**A Deep Dive into Onchain Stablecoin Data**](https://solanafloor.com/news/stablecoin-supply-on-solana-hits-record-highs-a-deep-dive-into-onchain-data?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
Stablecoin activity on Solana is booming, and it’s not just a side effect of the memecoin frenzy. With over $1.2 billion in stablecoins minted in March and total supply hitting its highest point since early 2021, new onchain data shows growth across the board. This deep dive breaks down where that supply is going, who’s using it, how trading volume is shifting, and why stablecoins are a foundational layer of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.

1jlf1ew,Need Help: Script to Find Liquidity Pool Address from Token Mint (Nothing Working!),"Hey r/solana and r/solanadev,

I'm losing my mind trying to write a Python script that can find the **liquidity pool address** for a given **token mint address** (e.g., for [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), Raydium, or Orca). Every approach I’ve tried either:

* Returns empty results
* Hangs indefinitely
* Shows pools with the wrong tokens

# What I Need:

A script that:

1. Takes a **token mint address** (e.g., `8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump`)
2. Returns its **liquidity pool address** (e.g., `DUbj6toQ8aR7LFCZd26LsVbnKMPjAxSahB7eDjGurv26`)
3. Works reliably on **mainnet**

# What I’ve Tried:

1. `getProgramAccounts` with filters (fails or returns wrong pools):pythonCopyfilters = \[     {""dataSize"": 324},  # or 400     {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": token\_mint}} \]
2. **Raydium’s program ID** (`675kPX9MHTjS2zt...`) – detects pools but not mine.
3. **Pump.fun’s new program ID** (`6EF8rrecth...`) – timeouts.

# Question:

* **How do I find the correct** `offset` **for my token in the pool data?**
* **Is there a better RPC method or API (DexScreener, Birdeye, etc.)?**
* **Can someone share a working script?**



Here’s my latest failing code:

    import requests
    
    RPC_URL = ""https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com""
    MINT = ""8Fz3TiDx4iS5zqndd6LzFMibaoogP6YHAo9AhFNTpump""
    
    def get_pools():
        payload = {
            ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
            ""id"": 1,
            ""method"": ""getProgramAccounts"",
            ""params"": [
                ""pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA"", 
                {
                    ""filters"": [
                        {""dataSize"": 324},
                        {""memcmp"": {""offset"": 8, ""bytes"": MINT}}
                    ],
                    ""encoding"": ""base64""
                }
            ]
        }
        response = requests.post(RPC_URL, json=payload).json()
        print(response)  # EMPTY :(
    
    get_pools()

# What Happens?

* **No errors**, just empty results.
* If I remove the filter, I see pools but with **unrelated tokens**.

# Help Me Fix:

1. Is the **program ID** wrong?
2. Is the **offset** incorrect?
3. Should I use **WebSockets** instead?

1jk8e62,Pump.fun etc needs to end.,"Bit of a rant.

If solana wants to be taken seriously and not taint it's image as a ""genuine"" block chain, rug pulls and scams need to go, they have to get a hold on this in my honest opinion.

I'm all for meme coins and community building etc, but, People are breaking the law everyday on solana, the block chain for criminals.

I'm just not feeling it's current direction, is this seriously the pinnacle of this tech? 

The same applies for like 90% of the crypto market, just fast cash grabs. it's just heading in a totally dumb direction, solana just happens to hold the highest concentration of degenerates.

I can't be the only one here??

1jk7oed,A better trading experience:,"Deep into the pump fun domination, it seems nothing else could potentially loosen the grip pump fun has over the solana space. Protocols have tried and offered their own modified versions of essentially the same product, and have had next to no success. They could offer far better terms, better creator rewards and a bunch of better things, but the users won’t budge.



In one way, this is the sign of a great product, people are happy with the ways things are and don’t want to change. This is where the volume is, where people are trading and that in itself makes the place legitimate. People aren’t willing to test out the competition, they don’t have the branding, liquidity or loyalty.



Trying to beat pump fun at its own game isn’t a winning play. Sure, you could disrupt the market, but you would never be able to make a permanent dent. But what if you didn’t try to copy pump fun, and instead provided a means to an end for what users what, in a completely unrivalled form?



Pre launch sales used to be all the hype, someone would tweet out a contract address and have millions of dollars sent straight away with no questions asked, and no clear product. (Ben.eth I’m looking at you.)While this does lead to a lot of chaos, a lot of rugs and clearly a lot of pumps, what if there was a way to get all of the benefits without having to sacrifice to the unpredictability of it all?



That’s why I have built a pre launch sale site from the ground up. Everything is completely automated, guaranteed and safe. The user no longer has to worry about if they will get their tokens or not, or if xyz influencer is going to run with the bag.



Clear parameters are one of the main focuses of the site, with the ability to set all of the intended token details, decide the amount going to the liquidity pool vs users, customisation on the creator reward for a successful launch, my site perfectly fills what is a mostly forgotten meta.



Softcap, hard cap and a countdown all add to the security of knowing exactly what’s going to happen. If your launch doesn’t hit the softcap in the designated time? No worries, the users are refunded their contributions automatically. If you do launch your pre launch sale? Everything is automated for you. From the token creation, liquidity pool management, to working out how many tokens each person needs based on their contribution. Everything is done for you.



Allowing for custom creator rewards also allows creators to show they’re not all grift. You can set your reward to 0 if this is truly something you believe in. Having the transparency of exactly where a creators loyalty resides, is one of the major benefits of having a platform like this. You can see exactly what the plans are, contribute safely and best of all, trust that at the end you will receive your end of the bargain. 



With everything fully built and pretty much ready to go, it’s a no brainer that I should have launched this already and had this available on the market. But I feel like with some better planning, branding and marketing, this platform would have all of the required elements to fully rival a giant like pump fun. If this is something that interests you, you want to see more, or you just like the idea, feel free to contact me and I’d love to hear what you think.

1jjmnva,"XRP is the biggest shitcoin, prove me wrong! pt.2","I made the attached post few hours ago and seems lot of XRP fanboys are furious, so lets double down!

\*\*1. XRP acts as a bridge currency between banks and financial institutions, crypto aims to replace the very thing!

a. the main counterpoint here was XRP is fast & cost effective compared to SWIFT and would be a great idea to replace the existing tech with XRPL sure not a bad idea lets assume XRP somehow manages to replace SWIFT their only competitor and lately there have been some partnership rumours (ironic), but yeah lets calculate the valuation of SWIFT if it were publicly listed company...

SWIFT generates revenue by charging fees for its services, primarily per-message fees which is somewhere around 0.2$, SWIFT processed 44 million messages daily, totalling approximately 16 billion messages annually.

16 billion messages × $0.20/message = $3.2 billion in revenue.

Valuation Calculation:

Revenue: $3.2 billion.

P/S Range: 10 to 15 (industry avg.)

Lower end: $3.2 billion × 10 = $32 billion.

Upper end: $3.2 billion × 15 = $48 billion.

so hypothetically XRP should be worth 48B in mcap, but taking over a existing industry monopoly is highly unlikely.

\*\*2.  XRP does not use POW or POS so nothing in it for community, so everyone who praises are like cult followers similar to that of shitcoin.

a. Validator nodes on the XRP Ledger have earned 0 XRP from the network since launch, as transaction fees are burned with no direct rewards.

b. XRPL selects who can run a node on the network.

\*\*3. Transaction speed is faster for XRP(since centralised) so does solana and dozens of eth L2's.

a. Solana and Polygon each processes 65,000tx/s which is faster than that of XRP's 1500tx/s.

b.  XRPL selects who can run a node on the network, which is changing lately but with no incentive to run a node!

\*\*4. XRP has 100B pre-mined, 47% circulating/ dumped on retail owns 53% in escrow accounts, which is worse than shitcoins!

a. I've been little off on this one but what i found out was way worse...

b. XRP debuted with a fixed total supply of 100 billion pre-mined tokens created in full at launch (compare that with pumpfun shitcoins have 1B total supply).

c. Ripple’s founders (e.g., Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen) and early investors got 20B in total, thats 20% of total supply.

d. Based on current data xrp has so far dumped 58B tokens on retail with as much as removal of 1B XRP per month from escrow. i,e 2.44 Billion dollar (based on current valuation) ready to dump on retail.

e. so far **13,698,922** XRP has been burned in fees which is 0.0137% of total supply.

\*\*5. Bonus point for all those who like to compare XRP with SOLANA and ETH!

|Metric|XRP|Solana|Ethereum|

\*The most common comment was everything is shitcoin except bitcoin! To those I would like to say... anything on blockchain that is decentralised and produces revenue annually by any means is backed by that revenue and thus not a shitcoin! eg, sol, eth and multiple other protocols!

\*The only reason I posted it on solana sub because I consider myself integral part of the solana community and rest can go get rugged!

p.s if you want me to post another thread on how much i actually think XRP is worth let me know in comments!

1jjgj0v,I tested a bunch of Solana RPC providers — here’s my take 🧵,"Spent the last few weeks testing Solana RPCs for NFT stuff, bots, dashboards, etc. Here's my personal breakdown of Helius, InstantNodes, QuickNode, Ligma, and Triton:

**🥇 Helius – The all-in-one Solana dev toolbox**

If you’re building anything on Solana and want prebuilt tools like NFT APIs, token portfolio data, or real-time webhooks — Helius makes life so much easier. It basically gives you indexing and infra in one. Their DAS API is 🔥 and webhook system is a game changer for reacting to mints, transfers, etc. Performance is solid and scales well.

**🥈 InstantNodes – Fastest for heavy data & smart routing**

This one surprised me. InstantNodes uses a hybrid setup where light RPC calls go to shared nodes, and heavy ones (like big account scans or getProgramAccounts) get routed to beefier backend nodes. It means everything stays snappy even under load. Great for dashboards, bots, or any app hammering the RPC. Support is via Telegram, and while it’s helpful, it doesn’t feel very “enterprise” — there’s not much in terms of dashboards or monitoring tools. Also, no free tier — plans start around $499/month.

**🥉 QuickNode — reliable, polished, and great for multi-chain apps**

QuickNode’s biggest win is how easy it is to get started — the dashboard is clean, you get 10M free credits monthly, and it supports multiple chains out of the box. Perfect for MVPs or wallets that touch more than just Solana. Performance is solid, though if you're doing anything latency-sensitive or Solana-specific (like racing mints), you’ll probably want to upgrade — the free tier isn’t super snappy, and some Solana features (like Streams) require writing JS filters or paying for add-ons. Still, it's very dev-friendly and scalable if you're not doing ultra low-latency stuff.

**⚡ Ligma — built for degen botters and mint snipers**  
  
This one’s designed for raw transaction speed. They claim up to 6,000+ TPS, and they partner with validators to help your TXs land faster. In testing, it absolutely gives bots an edge in congested moments like mints. You get gRPC support, direct IP access (which cuts latency even more), and high TX throughput even on shared plans. But it’s definitely not polished — docs are barebones, support is all Telegram/Discord, and there’s no real dashboard. If you’re cool with that and just want raw power for bots or sniping, it does the job really well.

**💰 Triton — premium option for mission-critical infra**  
  
Triton feels like the most ""serious"" option out there. Their infra is built to never go down — they use multiple regions and providers, so even if a datacenter dies, your app stays up. You can get dedicated nodes with super low latency (\~400ms or better), which is great for exchanges, market makers, or liquidation bots. But this comes at a cost: you’re looking at $500/month minimum, and they don’t offer fancy APIs or a free tier — it’s pure RPC. If you’re running something that absolutely can’t fail, it’s worth every dollar. But for smaller apps or solo devs, it’s likely overkill.",rfjtdjhc,solana,32,0,32,0.97,19,1742899758.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jjgj0v/i_tested_a_bunch_of_solana_rpc_providers_heres_my/,True,506,False,DeFi,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-25 10:49:18

1jjexni,🚀 Iris: The Solana Transaction Sender Built to Dominate the Slot Race,"Tired of Solana’s transaction execution feeling like a **back-alley knife fight**? Let’s talk.

Jito bundles ignoring your priority fees? Custom TPU ports like Paladin and \[Redacted\] turning routing into a *solver’s nightmare*? We’ve been there. At Astralane, we cracked the code on Solana’s chaotic execution layer ([deep dive here](https://medium.com/@astralaneio/paying-more-wont-save-you-solanas-new-rules-of-transaction-execution-78d169b23ab9)), and now we’re launching **Iris**—the transaction sender that **guarantees 0-1 slot P90 execution**.

# Why Iris?

* **Outsmart Jito**: Our routing logic bypasses broken schedulers. Your fees *actually* matter here.
* **Slash Through TPU Chaos**: Paladin, \[Redacted\]? Iris auto-detects and routes with surgical precision.
* **Stat or Die Trying**: 0-1 slot landings for 90% of transactions. *Try us.*
* **No PhD Required**: Integrate in 5 lines of code. Spend less time debugging, more time printing.

# “But How?”

We rebuilt the stack from the ground up. Custom UDP pipelines, battle-tested routing logic, and a sprinkle of ✨*dark magic*✨. Think of Iris as your VIP pass to Solana’s hottest block parties.

1jipixf,Is it possible to restrict minted tokens to only be tradable within my private platform (Solana)?,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a private platform on Solana where users can mint tokens. However, I want to **limit trading of these minted tokens strictly within my platform**. The goal is that **only registered users of my platform can hold, buy, or sell these tokens**, and **no external bots or actors should be able to snipe the token supply** or interact with it in any way.

From what I’ve read, at the moment of token creation on Solana, **some bots are able to detect the mint and buy up supply within seconds**, which is exactly what I want to prevent.

So the core question is:

Is there a way to mint tokens on Solana that are only tradable (or even visible) within a private ecosystem and cannot be accessed or purchased by external parties or bots?

I'm open to workarounds like custom smart contracts, gating mechanisms, or even hybrid solutions—anything that would allow me to protect early-stage token distribution and enforce exclusivity for my users.

Any help, pointers, or advice would be massively appreciated. Thanks!

1ji53vq,This bot generates hundreds of K per month,"**Hey guys, I hope someone here can help me.**

I’ve been following this bot for several months now. As you can see ([https://gmgn.ai/sol/address/LnxGo8pT\_o7RY6P2vQMuGSu1TrLM81weuzgDjaCRTXYRaXJwWcvc](https://gmgn.ai/sol/address/LnxGo8pT_o7RY6P2vQMuGSu1TrLM81weuzgDjaCRTXYRaXJwWcvc)), it generates hundreds of thousands of dollars per month. It operates on Solana memecoins. After analyzing its behavior, I managed to understand a few key aspects of how it works:

1. It only enters newly created tokens and executes trades at the exact same moment as the token’s DEV.
2. It operates exclusively on Pump.fun.
3. It uses dynamic take profits based not on percentage gains but on time-based ranges combined with volume and liquidity. I’m sure of this because I’ve seen it make insane profits—sometimes even 1000x, 2000x, or 3000x returns.

At first glance, replicating this strategy might seem easy, since there are some “free” bots like Photon that allow you to snipe new [Pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) tokens at high speed and enter the market at the same time as the DEV.

But there’s a reason I’m here… I tried running Photon’s bot, entering new [Pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) token launches and setting fixed take profits (as a simple test) without using time-based take profits (which Photon also allows). The results were disastrous.

I deposited 2 SOL for this test, using fixed trades of 0.1 SOL. In a short time, I burned my entire capital. The bot traded around 50-60 tokens, and none of them resulted in a profit. I had set my first take profit at 100%.

So my question is: **How does this bot manage to generate such massive profits while seemingly using “the same strategy” I did?** Clearly, I’m missing some crucial information to make it work the same way. But after months of thinking about it, I still can’t figure out what I’m lacking.

If you observe this bot’s behavior, it appears to open trades on random tokens. On average, it executes a trade every 2-5 seconds. And since these are all new token launches, it’s not filtering based on liquidity, volume, or other similar metrics. **So how does it consistently generate such high profits?**

I really hope someone can help me figure this out.",Soggy-Lemon-2087,solana,313,0,313,0.89,252,1742752167.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1ji53vq/this_bot_generates_hundreds_of_k_per_month/,True,348,False,Meme,False,False,False,False,,2025-03-23 17:49:27

1jkhas0,ETH vs SOL Tokenization: By the Numbers,"**Tokenization is booming** — from U.S. treasuries to real estate and even gold, turning real-world assets (RWAs) into on-chain tokens is quickly becoming one of crypto’s most promising use cases. Big institutions like **BlackRock** and **Franklin Templeton** are already on-chain. The current U.S. administration has shown **support for digital asset innovation**, including tokenization, through recent executive orders and regulatory hearings.

Two blockchains are leading the charge: **Ethereum** and **Solana**.

# TL;DR:

* **Ethereum** dominates RWA tokenization today.
* **Solana** is growing fast, especially after BlackRock expanded a $1.7B fund to it (ETH was already included).
* Stablecoins make up the majority of tokenized value (\~97%), but bonds, funds, and loans are rising fast.

# Total Tokenized Asset Breakdown (Q1 2025)

    Chain     | Total Tokenized Assets | Stablecoins | RWAs (excluding-stablecoins)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Ethereum  | ~$69B+                 | ~$60–70B    | ~$3.8B+ (~80% of RWA mkt)
    Solana    | ~$8.2B                 | ~$8B        | ~$200M (likely >$1.8B w/ BUIDL)

*(Values approximate. Data:* [*rwa.xyz*](http://rwa.xyz)*, 21Shares, BlackRock/Securitize)*

# Ethereum: The Current Leader

* Hosts **$69B+** in tokenized assets, including stablecoins, treasuries, funds, loans, and real estate.
* Commands **80%+** of the **non-stablecoin** RWA market.
* Key protocols: **MakerDAO** (>$2.5B RWA), **Ondo**, **Backed**, **Centrifuge**, **Goldfinch**.
* **Stablecoins**: \~61% of USDC and \~47% of USDT on Ethereum.
* **Bonds & Funds**: BlackRock’s $1.7B BUIDL fund launched here in 2023.
* **Private Credit**: \~$9B tokenized loans.
* **Growth**: +32% in non-stablecoin RWA value in 2024 alone.

# Solana: The Fast-Rising Contender

* Grew from near-zero tokenized RWAs in 2023 to **$135M+** in Treasuries by late 2024.
* **BlackRock** expanding BUIDL to Solana in March 2025 could push its total over **$1.8B+**.
* **USDC** on Solana now 16% of total supply ($8B) up from <3% in 2022 
* **Real Estate/NFTs**: Homebase tokenized a rental property in TX; Franklin Templeton launched fund access.
* **Key strength**: Low-cost, high-speed infra ideal for scalable RWA activity.

# Stablecoins: The Elephant in the Room 

* Still **\~97%** of tokenized asset value.
* Ethereum leads with \~$60–70B in USDC, USDT, DAI, and others.
* Solana resurging with \~$8B in USDC and rising USDT share.

# Treasuries, Bonds & Tokenized Funds

* Market grew from **$100M in Jan 2023** to **$700M+ by Oct 2023**, mostly on Ethereum.
* Ethereum now hosts most tokenized T-bills, corporate bonds, and ETFs.
* Solana reached \~$135M by end of 2024 — still small, but rising fast.
* **BlackRock’s BUIDL fund** likely to drive a 10x spike in Solana’s on-chain RWA value.

# Credit, Real Estate, Gold & Other RWAs

* **Ethereum**: PAXG/XAUT (gold, \~$960M), RealT (tokenized rental homes), Centrifuge loans.
* **Solana**: NFT-based real estate pilots, early credit experiments, funds by Franklin Templeton.

Projected Growth: 

* Big consultancies and banks are extremely bullish on tokenization.

1jkfefb,A Future Web3 Without Headaches: The Idea of a Universal Blockchain!,"

Web3 has massive potential, but it's still a minefield for the average user. Between multiple wallets, transaction fees in different tokens, and those dreaded cross-chain transfers, the experience is far from seamless. Honestly, we can only imagine how many millions of dollars are lost every year due to simple mistakes like transferring to the wrong network. 

Here are the problems we all face:

* **Multiple wallets**: MetaMask for Ethereum, Phantom for Solana, Keplr for Cosmos… Each blockchain requires its own wallet. A real headache when you're trying to navigate quickly.
* **Transaction fees in different tokens**: ETH for Ethereum, BNB for BNB Chain, and each chain with its own specific fees. Personally, I’ve often left up to $5 in unused tokens in some wallets because of network fees.
* **Complex cross-chain transactions**: Bridges are often slow, expensive, and swapping… Oof. Nothing simple when you want to move tokens from one blockchain to another.

But then, why not a Universal Blockchain? 

Recently, I came across a project listed on Bitget that’s trying to solve these issues: **Particle Network**. They've managed to secure support from **Binance Labs** and seem to be working on a unified account that would allow interaction with both EVM blockchains (like Ethereum) and non-EVM blockchains (like Solana) seamlessly. The idea is to no longer worry about which blockchain you're using and to pay fees with any token. It's a good start, but for now, it only applies to wallets.

But I have a question: **Will we ever be able to send BTC and ETH to the same address?** 😎 Could we one day unify all this so we don't have to juggle with millions of technical solutions just to make a simple transaction?  
It still seems like a dream, but the advancements in cross-chain tech, like those we see with Cosmos, Polkadot, and others, suggest it could become a reality sooner than expected.

What do you think? Are we still far from a universal blockchain, or are we going to get there in the next few years?

Left crypto for a very long time. Came back in 2017 - invested in some nice ICOs which crashed to hell, and a bunch of useless altcoins like Nano, Raiblocks, Funfair, Verge, Etc etc. all crashed and burned.

Have been trying to catch up for the last few months again.

What are the main changes since then? The ones I've picked up are:

1) Meme coins are back in a big way. It's a lot more than just Dogecoin and Shiba Inu
2) Solana is getting a lot of hype but seems no different in value prop to nano in my opinion
3) Privacy coins are sanctioned and thus dying
4) Stablecoins are much more common, and are arguably the only real world use case
5) DEXs are now common place
6) DeFi is a thing, but the smart contracts are still super vulnerable to hacking
7) Cross chain bridges are a real thing now - I think that's the same as atomic swaps?
8) Proof of stake is now standard, and proof of work is dying?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the SECOND month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAR Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7+ years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **FEB Highlights:** Bloody month, all coins in the red. YTD **XRP** is in the lead and the only crypto in positive territory.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+237% vs S&P500's +64% - see below for details).

# Month Two – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/krbogpex1uqe1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a09c5bab9e51dd4a091cc97943e49d3f4a6546

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

February highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* All red month with **BNB** and **Tron** falling the least
* **AVAX** drops well out of the Top Ten
* **XRP** in overall lead and only crypto in positive territory

# February Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/1xxa4o822uqe1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffae3797b18e3f425b4a85e30c371feab562daf

Besides the quickly dropping **AVAX**, all coins remain in the Top Ten.

# February Winners and Losers

***February Winners*** – None, although **BNB** and **Tron** fall the least, both -9% in February.

***February Losers*** – **SOL** and **DOGE** (both -37%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: XRP maintains lead and is the only crypto in positive territory; after two months, portfolio -18%.

After a fairly good start to 2025 ([the portfolio was +7% in January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)) the latest Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.

Year to date **XRP** (+3%) maintains a healthy lead over second place **BTC** (-8%) followed by third place **Tron** (-10%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** two months ago is worth $103 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The portfolio lost $250 in February so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$816.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, two months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/8fgzaim92uqe1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07259da039dc63ed5a09aad3b55ef6291e69940

**February Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -23% 
* **COIN50**: -24%

The February monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio (barely)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -22%

Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/410gpsxc2uqe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66c08b1c987c629f4d60c7487672764c06ecb48

**That’s up +237%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/h154ietd2uqe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=39ce8d8143bee4babf7f74df455d8ddfeeb847cf

In summary: ***That’s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +1% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,012 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

1jkp24m,Advice for a newbie?,"Hello, how are you?

I've just entered the world of cryptocurrencies and I'm fascinated. I've seen my money yield amounts that are already significant to me, but when I look at the historical charts, I notice that everything has been quite stable since I joined, fluctuating at the same level, and that there have been much more considerable highs and lows in the past. I've studied a fair bit, and I know I'm a complete amateur, but I bought 200 dollars worth of each of the following coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Polkadot, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche. I know it is not that much and I'll keep investing. I don’t need short-term profit and I’m saving and setting goals. Now, I’m completely lost, because I imagine we’re in a moment of sideways movement, and in the last two days my coins have gone up quite a bit, but I saw that it’s nothing compared to what can actually happen. I see people saying we’re about to have an alt season, others saying we’re in a bear trap and Bitcoin is going to rise more, and some saying it’s going to keep moving sideways... Is this uncertainty always part of the crypto market, or are there trends that always repeat? What do you think is going on right now?

1jkkgdt,"USDC Reaches $60 Billion Market Cap, Setting New Record","""USDC has hit a record market capitalization of **$60.2 billion**, doubling in value over the past year.

As a result, the total stablecoin market cap has also reached a new all-time high, climbing past $230 billion. For comparison, the stablecoin market first went beyond the $200 billion mark in December 2024.

The surge in USDC’s market cap to $60.2 billion reflects Circle’s ongoing efforts to scale its infrastructure and broaden the token’s global adoption.

USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, behind only Tether (USDT), which currently exceeds $144 billion.

A major driver of USDC’s expansion has been Circle’s multichain strategy. Several key blockchain networks now integrate the stablecoin, including:

* ***Ethereum (over $36 billion)***
* ***Solana ($10 billion)***
* ***Base ($3.8 billion)***
* ***Hyperliquid ($2.2 billion)***
* ***Arbitrum ($1.8 billion)***

1jkhas0,ETH vs SOL Tokenization: By the Numbers,"**Tokenization is booming** — from U.S. treasuries to real estate and even gold, turning real-world assets (RWAs) into on-chain tokens is quickly becoming one of crypto’s most promising use cases. Big institutions like **BlackRock** and **Franklin Templeton** are already on-chain. The current U.S. administration has shown **support for digital asset innovation**, including tokenization, through recent executive orders and regulatory hearings.

Two blockchains are leading the charge: **Ethereum** and **Solana**.

# TL;DR:

* **Ethereum** dominates RWA tokenization today.
* **Solana** is growing fast, especially after BlackRock expanded a $1.7B fund to it (ETH was already included).
* Stablecoins make up the majority of tokenized value (\~97%), but bonds, funds, and loans are rising fast.

# Total Tokenized Asset Breakdown (Q1 2025)

    Chain     | Total Tokenized Assets | Stablecoins | RWAs (excluding-stablecoins)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Ethereum  | ~$69B+                 | ~$60–70B    | ~$3.8B+ (~80% of RWA mkt)
    Solana    | ~$8.2B                 | ~$8B        | ~$200M (likely >$1.8B w/ BUIDL)

*(Values approximate. Data:* [*rwa.xyz*](http://rwa.xyz)*, 21Shares, BlackRock/Securitize)*

# Ethereum: The Current Leader

* Hosts **$69B+** in tokenized assets, including stablecoins, treasuries, funds, loans, and real estate.
* Commands **80%+** of the **non-stablecoin** RWA market.
* Key protocols: **MakerDAO** (>$2.5B RWA), **Ondo**, **Backed**, **Centrifuge**, **Goldfinch**.
* **Stablecoins**: \~61% of USDC and \~47% of USDT on Ethereum.
* **Bonds & Funds**: BlackRock’s $1.7B BUIDL fund launched here in 2023.
* **Private Credit**: \~$9B tokenized loans.
* **Growth**: +32% in non-stablecoin RWA value in 2024 alone.

# Solana: The Fast-Rising Contender

* Grew from near-zero tokenized RWAs in 2023 to **$135M+** in Treasuries by late 2024.
* **BlackRock** expanding BUIDL to Solana in March 2025 could push its total over **$1.8B+**.
* **USDC** on Solana now 16% of total supply ($8B) up from <3% in 2022 
* **Real Estate/NFTs**: Homebase tokenized a rental property in TX; Franklin Templeton launched fund access.
* **Key strength**: Low-cost, high-speed infra ideal for scalable RWA activity.

# Stablecoins: The Elephant in the Room 

* Still **\~97%** of tokenized asset value.
* Ethereum leads with \~$60–70B in USDC, USDT, DAI, and others.
* Solana resurging with \~$8B in USDC and rising USDT share.

# Treasuries, Bonds & Tokenized Funds

* Market grew from **$100M in Jan 2023** to **$700M+ by Oct 2023**, mostly on Ethereum.
* Ethereum now hosts most tokenized T-bills, corporate bonds, and ETFs.
* Solana reached \~$135M by end of 2024 — still small, but rising fast.
* **BlackRock’s BUIDL fund** likely to drive a 10x spike in Solana’s on-chain RWA value.

# Credit, Real Estate, Gold & Other RWAs

* **Ethereum**: PAXG/XAUT (gold, \~$960M), RealT (tokenized rental homes), Centrifuge loans.
* **Solana**: NFT-based real estate pilots, early credit experiments, funds by Franklin Templeton.

Projected Growth: 

* Big consultancies and banks are extremely bullish on tokenization. Citi famously projected up to $4–5 trillion of tokenized assets by 2030, and Boston Consulting Group said even $16T in a decade in a bullish scenario ​[coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/17/tokenized-rwas-could-grow-to-a-10t-market-by-2030-as-crypto-converges-to-tradfi-report#:~:text=potential%20of%20tokenizing%20%20,real%20estate%20to%20blockchain%20rails). [21.co](http://21.co) (parent of 21Shares) gave a range of $3.5T (bear case) to $10T (bull case) by 2030 ​[coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/17/tokenized-rwas-could-grow-to-a-10t-market-by-2030-as-crypto-converges-to-tradfi-report#:~:text=The%20market%20for%20tokenized%20assets,co%20said%20in%20a%20report). While those figures include all asset types, it implies a potential \~100x increase from today’s \~$15B (ex-stables) on-chain. If that happens, Ethereum and Solana will likely be two of the biggest platforms handling that flood of value. Both are positioning themselves: Ethereum by focusing on security and Layer-2 scaling, and Solana by courting institutions with fast, cheap throughput.

# Final Take:

* In summary, **Ethereum remains the king of RWA tokenization for now**, but **Solana is rapidly gaining ground** as the technology and trust in it matures. The pie is growing fast – so both are likely winners if current trends continue. The race is less about *whether* RWAs will come on-chain (that seems inevitable at this point, given the clear cost and efficiency benefits​. If tokenized assets reach $4-5 trillion by 2030, both Ethereum and Solana will be large beneficiaries.

1jkfefb,A Future Web3 Without Headaches: The Idea of a Universal Blockchain!,"

Web3 has massive potential, but it's still a minefield for the average user. Between multiple wallets, transaction fees in different tokens, and those dreaded cross-chain transfers, the experience is far from seamless. Honestly, we can only imagine how many millions of dollars are lost every year due to simple mistakes like transferring to the wrong network. 

Here are the problems we all face:

* **Multiple wallets**: MetaMask for Ethereum, Phantom for Solana, Keplr for Cosmos… Each blockchain requires its own wallet. A real headache when you're trying to navigate quickly.
* **Transaction fees in different tokens**: ETH for Ethereum, BNB for BNB Chain, and each chain with its own specific fees. Personally, I’ve often left up to $5 in unused tokens in some wallets because of network fees.
* **Complex cross-chain transactions**: Bridges are often slow, expensive, and swapping… Oof. Nothing simple when you want to move tokens from one blockchain to another.

But then, why not a Universal Blockchain? 

Recently, I came across a project listed on Bitget that’s trying to solve these issues: **Particle Network**. They've managed to secure support from **Binance Labs** and seem to be working on a unified account that would allow interaction with both EVM blockchains (like Ethereum) and non-EVM blockchains (like Solana) seamlessly. The idea is to no longer worry about which blockchain you're using and to pay fees with any token. It's a good start, but for now, it only applies to wallets.

But I have a question: **Will we ever be able to send BTC and ETH to the same address?** 😎 Could we one day unify all this so we don't have to juggle with millions of technical solutions just to make a simple transaction?  
It still seems like a dream, but the advancements in cross-chain tech, like those we see with Cosmos, Polkadot, and others, suggest it could become a reality sooner than expected.

1jjv0r1,What have I missed since 2017?,"I'm an old timer here. Mined my first bitcoin on a GPU in 2012 on Slush pool. Also sold it for a nice tidy profit of £150.

Left crypto for a very long time. Came back in 2017 - invested in some nice ICOs which crashed to hell, and a bunch of useless altcoins like Nano, Raiblocks, Funfair, Verge, Etc etc. all crashed and burned.

Have been trying to catch up for the last few months again.

What are the main changes since then? The ones I've picked up are:

1) Meme coins are back in a big way. It's a lot more than just Dogecoin and Shiba Inu
2) Solana is getting a lot of hype but seems no different in value prop to nano in my opinion
3) Privacy coins are sanctioned and thus dying
4) Stablecoins are much more common, and are arguably the only real world use case
5) DEXs are now common place
6) DeFi is a thing, but the smart contracts are still super vulnerable to hacking
7) Cross chain bridges are a real thing now - I think that's the same as atomic swaps?
8) Proof of stake is now standard, and proof of work is dying?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the SECOND month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAR Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7+ years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **FEB Highlights:** Bloody month, all coins in the red. YTD **XRP** is in the lead and the only crypto in positive territory.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+237% vs S&P500's +64% - see below for details).

# Month Two – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/krbogpex1uqe1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a09c5bab9e51dd4a091cc97943e49d3f4a6546

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

February highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* All red month with **BNB** and **Tron** falling the least
* **AVAX** drops well out of the Top Ten
* **XRP** in overall lead and only crypto in positive territory

# February Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/1xxa4o822uqe1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffae3797b18e3f425b4a85e30c371feab562daf

Besides the quickly dropping **AVAX**, all coins remain in the Top Ten.

# February Winners and Losers

***February Winners*** – None, although **BNB** and **Tron** fall the least, both -9% in February.

***February Losers*** – **SOL** and **DOGE** (both -37%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: XRP maintains lead and is the only crypto in positive territory; after two months, portfolio -18%.

After a fairly good start to 2025 ([the portfolio was +7% in January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)) the latest Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.

Year to date **XRP** (+3%) maintains a healthy lead over second place **BTC** (-8%) followed by third place **Tron** (-10%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** two months ago is worth $103 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The portfolio lost $250 in February so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$816.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, two months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/8fgzaim92uqe1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07259da039dc63ed5a09aad3b55ef6291e69940

**February Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -23% 
* **COIN50**: -24%

The February monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio (barely)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -22%

Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/410gpsxc2uqe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66c08b1c987c629f4d60c7487672764c06ecb48

**That’s up +237%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/h154ietd2uqe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=39ce8d8143bee4babf7f74df455d8ddfeeb847cf

In summary: ***That’s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +1% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,012 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  February’s extended report is on the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74).  For more data, you can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23), and [2024 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well.

1jiskul,Is it looking more likely for an early approval of a spot Solana ETF?,"Many Polymarket users have been predicting a high percentage chance that the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Solana ETF in 2025. For the past months, there has been a very low hope for this, so this has happened to be a significant improvement regarding the issue.  
  
One key reason is the anticipated appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the new SEC Chair. It has boosted confidence in a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency-based financial products. Many analysts believe that this increases the likelihood of additional altcoin ETFs receiving regulatory approval.   
  
To me, The SEC’s classification of SOL as a security in ongoing lawsuits adds regulatory looks like a challenge to the approval process. With the potential demand for Solana ETFs not being grounded. And Altcoin ETFs getting less money invested in them compared to Bitcoin’s which signifies how investors may not be as interested in them. I know the approval outcome can depend on evolving regulatory perspectives, institutional initiatives, and market demand.

1jkp24m,Advice for a newbie?,"Hello, how are you?

I've just entered the world of cryptocurrencies and I'm fascinated. I've seen my money yield amounts that are already significant to me, but when I look at the historical charts, I notice that everything has been quite stable since I joined, fluctuating at the same level, and that there have been much more considerable highs and lows in the past. I've studied a fair bit, and I know I'm a complete amateur, but I bought 200 dollars worth of each of the following coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Polkadot, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche. I know it is not that much and I'll keep investing. I don’t need short-term profit and I’m saving and setting goals. Now, I’m completely lost, because I imagine we’re in a moment of sideways movement, and in the last two days my coins have gone up quite a bit, but I saw that it’s nothing compared to what can actually happen. I see people saying we’re about to have an alt season, others saying we’re in a bear trap and Bitcoin is going to rise more, and some saying it’s going to keep moving sideways... Is this uncertainty always part of the crypto market, or are there trends that always repeat? What do you think is going on right now?

1jkkgdt,"USDC Reaches $60 Billion Market Cap, Setting New Record","""USDC has hit a record market capitalization of **$60.2 billion**, doubling in value over the past year.

As a result, the total stablecoin market cap has also reached a new all-time high, climbing past $230 billion. For comparison, the stablecoin market first went beyond the $200 billion mark in December 2024.

The surge in USDC’s market cap to $60.2 billion reflects Circle’s ongoing efforts to scale its infrastructure and broaden the token’s global adoption.

USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, behind only Tether (USDT), which currently exceeds $144 billion.

A major driver of USDC’s expansion has been Circle’s multichain strategy. Several key blockchain networks now integrate the stablecoin, including:

* ***Ethereum (over $36 billion)***
* ***Solana ($10 billion)***
* ***Base ($3.8 billion)***
* ***Hyperliquid ($2.2 billion)***
* ***Arbitrum ($1.8 billion)***

1jkhas0,ETH vs SOL Tokenization: By the Numbers,"**Tokenization is booming** — from U.S. treasuries to real estate and even gold, turning real-world assets (RWAs) into on-chain tokens is quickly becoming one of crypto’s most promising use cases. Big institutions like **BlackRock** and **Franklin Templeton** are already on-chain. The current U.S. administration has shown **support for digital asset innovation**, including tokenization, through recent executive orders and regulatory hearings.

Two blockchains are leading the charge: **Ethereum** and **Solana**.

# TL;DR:

* **Ethereum** dominates RWA tokenization today.
* **Solana** is growing fast, especially after BlackRock expanded a $1.7B fund to it (ETH was already included).
* Stablecoins make up the majority of tokenized value (\~97%), but bonds, funds, and loans are rising fast.

# Total Tokenized Asset Breakdown (Q1 2025)

    Chain     | Total Tokenized Assets | Stablecoins | RWAs (excluding-stablecoins)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Ethereum  | ~$69B+                 | ~$60–70B    | ~$3.8B+ (~80% of RWA mkt)
    Solana    | ~$8.2B                 | ~$8B        | ~$200M (likely >$1.8B w/ BUIDL)

*(Values approximate. Data:* [*rwa.xyz*](http://rwa.xyz)*, 21Shares, BlackRock/Securitize)*

# Ethereum: The Current Leader

* Hosts **$69B+** in tokenized assets, including stablecoins, treasuries, funds, loans, and real estate.
* Commands **80%+** of the **non-stablecoin** RWA market.
* Key protocols: **MakerDAO** (>$2.5B RWA), **Ondo**, **Backed**, **Centrifuge**, **Goldfinch**.
* **Stablecoins**: \~61% of USDC and \~47% of USDT on Ethereum.
* **Bonds & Funds**: BlackRock’s $1.7B BUIDL fund launched here in 2023.
* **Private Credit**: \~$9B tokenized loans.
* **Growth**: +32% in non-stablecoin RWA value in 2024 alone.

# Solana: The Fast-Rising Contender

* Grew from near-zero tokenized RWAs in 2023 to **$135M+** in Treasuries by late 2024.
* **BlackRock** expanding BUIDL to Solana in March 2025 could push its total over **$1.8B+**.
* **USDC** on Solana now 16% of total supply ($8B) up from <3% in 2022 
* **Real Estate/NFTs**: Homebase tokenized a rental property in TX; Franklin Templeton launched fund access.
* **Key strength**: Low-cost, high-speed infra ideal for scalable RWA activity.

# Stablecoins: The Elephant in the Room 

* Still **\~97%** of tokenized asset value.
* Ethereum leads with \~$60–70B in USDC, USDT, DAI, and others.
* Solana resurging with \~$8B in USDC and rising USDT share.

# Treasuries, Bonds & Tokenized Funds

* Market grew from **$100M in Jan 2023** to **$700M+ by Oct 2023**, mostly on Ethereum.
* Ethereum now hosts most tokenized T-bills, corporate bonds, and ETFs.
* Solana reached \~$135M by end of 2024 — still small, but rising fast.
* **BlackRock’s BUIDL fund** likely to drive a 10x spike in Solana’s on-chain RWA value.

# Credit, Real Estate, Gold & Other RWAs

* **Ethereum**: PAXG/XAUT (gold, \~$960M), RealT (tokenized rental homes), Centrifuge loans.
* **Solana**: NFT-based real estate pilots, early credit experiments, funds by Franklin Templeton.

Projected Growth: 

* Big consultancies and banks are extremely bullish on tokenization. Citi famously projected up to $4–5 trillion of tokenized assets by 2030, and Boston Consulting Group said even $16T in a decade in a bullish scenario ​[coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/17/tokenized-rwas-could-grow-to-a-10t-market-by-2030-as-crypto-converges-to-tradfi-report#:~:text=potential%20of%20tokenizing%20%20,real%20estate%20to%20blockchain%20rails). [21.co](http://21.co) (parent of 21Shares) gave a range of $3.5T (bear case) to $10T (bull case) by 2030 ​[coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/17/tokenized-rwas-could-grow-to-a-10t-market-by-2030-as-crypto-converges-to-tradfi-report#:~:text=The%20market%20for%20tokenized%20assets,co%20said%20in%20a%20report). While those figures include all asset types, it implies a potential \~100x increase from today’s \~$15B (ex-stables) on-chain. If that happens, Ethereum and Solana will likely be two of the biggest platforms handling that flood of value. Both are positioning themselves: Ethereum by focusing on security and Layer-2 scaling, and Solana by courting institutions with fast, cheap throughput.

# Final Take:

* In summary, **Ethereum remains the king of RWA tokenization for now**, but **Solana is rapidly gaining ground** as the technology and trust in it matures. The pie is growing fast – so both are likely winners if current trends continue. The race is less about *whether* RWAs will come on-chain (that seems inevitable at this point, given the clear cost and efficiency benefits​. If tokenized assets reach $4-5 trillion by 2030, both Ethereum and Solana will be large beneficiaries.

Web3 has massive potential, but it's still a minefield for the average user. Between multiple wallets, transaction fees in different tokens, and those dreaded cross-chain transfers, the experience is far from seamless. Honestly, we can only imagine how many millions of dollars are lost every year due to simple mistakes like transferring to the wrong network. 

Here are the problems we all face:

* **Multiple wallets**: MetaMask for Ethereum, Phantom for Solana, Keplr for Cosmos… Each blockchain requires its own wallet. A real headache when you're trying to navigate quickly.
* **Transaction fees in different tokens**: ETH for Ethereum, BNB for BNB Chain, and each chain with its own specific fees. Personally, I’ve often left up to $5 in unused tokens in some wallets because of network fees.
* **Complex cross-chain transactions**: Bridges are often slow, expensive, and swapping… Oof. Nothing simple when you want to move tokens from one blockchain to another.

But then, why not a Universal Blockchain? 

Recently, I came across a project listed on Bitget that’s trying to solve these issues: **Particle Network**. They've managed to secure support from **Binance Labs** and seem to be working on a unified account that would allow interaction with both EVM blockchains (like Ethereum) and non-EVM blockchains (like Solana) seamlessly. The idea is to no longer worry about which blockchain you're using and to pay fees with any token. It's a good start, but for now, it only applies to wallets.

But I have a question: **Will we ever be able to send BTC and ETH to the same address?** 😎 Could we one day unify all this so we don't have to juggle with millions of technical solutions just to make a simple transaction?  
It still seems like a dream, but the advancements in cross-chain tech, like those we see with Cosmos, Polkadot, and others, suggest it could become a reality sooner than expected.

What do you think? Are we still far from a universal blockchain, or are we going to get there in the next few years?

1jjv0r1,What have I missed since 2017?,"I'm an old timer here. Mined my first bitcoin on a GPU in 2012 on Slush pool. Also sold it for a nice tidy profit of £150.

Left crypto for a very long time. Came back in 2017 - invested in some nice ICOs which crashed to hell, and a bunch of useless altcoins like Nano, Raiblocks, Funfair, Verge, Etc etc. all crashed and burned.

Have been trying to catch up for the last few months again.

What are the main changes since then? The ones I've picked up are:

1) Meme coins are back in a big way. It's a lot more than just Dogecoin and Shiba Inu
2) Solana is getting a lot of hype but seems no different in value prop to nano in my opinion
3) Privacy coins are sanctioned and thus dying
4) Stablecoins are much more common, and are arguably the only real world use case
5) DEXs are now common place
6) DeFi is a thing, but the smart contracts are still super vulnerable to hacking
7) Cross chain bridges are a real thing now - I think that's the same as atomic swaps?
8) Proof of stake is now standard, and proof of work is dying?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the SECOND month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAR Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7+ years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **FEB Highlights:** Bloody month, all coins in the red. YTD **XRP** is in the lead and the only crypto in positive territory.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+237% vs S&P500's +64% - see below for details).

# Month Two – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/krbogpex1uqe1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a09c5bab9e51dd4a091cc97943e49d3f4a6546

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

February highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* All red month with **BNB** and **Tron** falling the least
* **AVAX** drops well out of the Top Ten
* **XRP** in overall lead and only crypto in positive territory

# February Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/1xxa4o822uqe1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffae3797b18e3f425b4a85e30c371feab562daf

Besides the quickly dropping **AVAX**, all coins remain in the Top Ten.

# February Winners and Losers

***February Winners*** – None, although **BNB** and **Tron** fall the least, both -9% in February.

***February Losers*** – **SOL** and **DOGE** (both -37%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: XRP maintains lead and is the only crypto in positive territory; after two months, portfolio -18%.

After a fairly good start to 2025 ([the portfolio was +7% in January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)) the latest Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.

Year to date **XRP** (+3%) maintains a healthy lead over second place **BTC** (-8%) followed by third place **Tron** (-10%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** two months ago is worth $103 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The portfolio lost $250 in February so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$816.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, two months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/8fgzaim92uqe1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07259da039dc63ed5a09aad3b55ef6291e69940

**February Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -23% 
* **COIN50**: -24%

The February monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio (barely)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -22%

Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/410gpsxc2uqe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66c08b1c987c629f4d60c7487672764c06ecb48

**That’s up +237%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/h154ietd2uqe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=39ce8d8143bee4babf7f74df455d8ddfeeb847cf

In summary: ***That’s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +1% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,012 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  February’s extended report is on the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74).  For more data, you can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23), and [2024 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well.

1jiskul,Is it looking more likely for an early approval of a spot Solana ETF?,"Many Polymarket users have been predicting a high percentage chance that the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Solana ETF in 2025. For the past months, there has been a very low hope for this, so this has happened to be a significant improvement regarding the issue.  
  
One key reason is the anticipated appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the new SEC Chair. It has boosted confidence in a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency-based financial products. Many analysts believe that this increases the likelihood of additional altcoin ETFs receiving regulatory approval.   
  
To me, The SEC’s classification of SOL as a security in ongoing lawsuits adds regulatory looks like a challenge to the approval process. With the potential demand for Solana ETFs not being grounded. And Altcoin ETFs getting less money invested in them compared to Bitcoin’s which signifies how investors may not be as interested in them. I know the approval outcome can depend on evolving regulatory perspectives, institutional initiatives, and market demand.

1jkpjsc,Possible to make good money?,"Hey Cryptodudes,

I'm a bit new to the market. Joined in 2021 at the tops. I know and I've seen that the market can pump really fast and really much and the same to the other side.

I know no one can answer that question, but crypo veterans since idk 2013 maybe already know ""how"" the system works. Join early and leave early?

I see many youtubers talking about solana going to 700$ (wtf??) How possible is that for you? I mean that would mean if I put 100k into solana it would 5x and make half a million just because it's ""bullrun""? It can't be that easy.
